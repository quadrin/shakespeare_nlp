fair whom young apollo courted for her hair and offered as a dower his burning throne where she should sit for men to gaze upon the outside of her garments were of lawn the lining purple silk with gilt stars drawn her wide sleeves green and bordered with a grove where venus in her naked glory strove to please the careless and disdainful eyes of proud adonis that before her lies her kirtle blue whereon was many a stain made with the blood of wretched lovers slain upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath from whence her veil reached to the ground beneath her veil was artificial flowers and leaves whose workmanship both man and beast deceives many would praise the sweet smell as she passed when twas the odour which her breath forth cast and there for honey bees have sought in vain and beat from thence have lighted there again about her neck hung chains of pebblestone which lightened by her neck like diamonds shone she ware no gloves for neither sun nor wind would burn or parch her hands but to her mind or warm or cool them for they took delight to play upon those hands they were so white buskins of shells all silvered used she and branched with blushing coral to the knee where sparrows perched of hollow pearl and gold such as the world would wonder to behold those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills which as she went would chirrup through the bills some say for her the fairest cupid pined and looking in her face was strooken blind but this is true so like was one the other as he imagined hero was his mother and oftentimes into her bosom flew about her naked neck his bare arms threw and laid his childish head upon her breast and with still panting rocked there took his rest so lovely fair was hero venus nun as nature wept thinking she was undone because she took more from her than she left and of such wondrous beauty her bereft therefore in sign her treasure suffered wrack since heros time hath half the world been black amorous leander beautiful and young whose tragedy divine musaeus sung dwelt at abydos since him dwelt there none for whom succeeding times make greater moan his dangling tresses that were never shorn had they been cut and unto colchos borne would have allured the ventrous youth of greece to hazard more than for the golden fleece fair cynthia wished his arms might be her sphere grief makes her pale because she moves not there his body was as straight as circes wand jove might have sipped out nectar from his hand even as delicious meat is to the taste so was his neck in touching and surpassed the white of pelops shoulder i could tell ye how smooth his breast was and how white his belly and whose immortal fingers did imprint that heavenly path with many a curious dint that runs along his back but my rude pen can hardly blazon forth the loves of men much less of powerful gods let it suffice that my slack muse sings of leanders eyes those orient cheeks and lips exceeding his that leaped into the water for a kiss of his own shadow and despising many died ere he could enjoy the love of any had wild hippolytus leander seen enamoured of his beauty had he been his presence made the rudest peasant melt that in the vast uplandish country dwelt the barbarous thracian soldier moved with nought was moved with him and for his favour sought some swore he was a maid in mans attire for in his looks were all that men desire a pleasant smiling cheek a speaking eye a brow for love to banquet royally and such as knew he was a man would say leander thou art made for amorous play why art thou not in love and loved of all though thou be fair yet be not thine own thrall the men of wealthy sestos every year for his sake whom their goddess held so dear rosecheeked adonis kept a solemn feast thither resorted many a wandering guest to meet their loves such as had none at all came lovers home from this great festival for every street like to a firmament glistered with breathing stars who where they went frighted the melancholy earth which deemed eternal heaven to burn for so it seemed as if another phaeton had got the guidance of the suns rich chariot but far above the loveliest hero shined and stole away th enchanted gazers mind for like sea nymphs enveigling harmony so was her beauty to the standers by nor that nightwandering pale and watry star when yawning dragons draw her thirling car from latmus mount up to the gloomy sky where crowned with blazing light and majesty she proudly sits more overrules the flood than she the hearts of those that near her stood even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase wretched ixions shaggy footed race incensed with savage heat gallop amain from steep pinebearing mountains to the plain so ran the people forth to gaze upon her and all that viewed her were enamoured on her and as in fury of a dreadful fight their fellows being slain or put to flight poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead strooken so at her presence all surprised and tooken await the sentence of her scornful eyes he whom she favours lives the other dies there might you see one sigh another rage and some their violent passions to assuage compile sharp satires but alas too late for faithful love will never turn to hate and many seeing great princes were denied pind as they went and thinking on her died on this feast day o cursed day and hour went hero thorough sestos from her tower to venus temple where unhappily as after chanced they did each other spy so fair a church as this had venus none the walls were of discoloured jasper stone wherein was proteus carved and oerhead a lively vine of green sea agate spread where by one hand lightheaded bacchus hung and with the other wine from grapes out wrung of crystal shining fair the pavement was the town of sestos called it venus glass there might you see the gods in sundry shapes committing heady riots incest rapes for know that underneath this radiant floor was danaes statue in a brazen tower jove slyly stealing from his sisters bed to dally with idalian ganymede and for his love europa bellowing loud and tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud blood quaffing mars heaving the iron net which limping vulcan and his cyclops set love kindling fire to burn such towns as troy sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy that now is turned into a cypress tree under whose shade the wood gods love to be and in the midst a silver altar stood there hero sacrificing turtles blood vailed to the ground vailing her eyelids close and modestly they opened as she rose thence flew loves arrow with the golden head and thus leander was enamoured stone still he stood and evermore he gazed till with the fire that from his countenance blazed relenting heros gentle heart was strook such force and virtue hath an amorous look it lies not in our power to love or hate for will in us is overruled by fate when two are stripped long ere the course begin we wish that one should lose the other win and one especially do we affect of two gold ingots like in each respect the reason no man knows let it suffice what we behold is censured by our eyes where both deliberate the love is slight who ever loved that loved not at first sight he kneeled but unto her devoutly prayed chaste hero to herself thus softly said were i the saint he worships i would hear him and as she spake those words came somewhat near him he started up she blushed as one ashamed wherewith leander much more was inflamed he touched her hand in touching it she trembled love deeply grounded hardly is dissembled these lovers parleyed by the touch of hands true love is mute and oft amazed stands thus while dumb signs their yielding hearts entangled the air with sparks of living fire was spangled and night deep drenched in misty acheron heaved up her head and half the world upon breathed darkness forth dark night is cupids day and now begins leander to display loves holy fire with words with sighs and tears which like sweet music entered heros ears and yet at every word she turned aside and always cut him off as he replied at last like to a bold sharp sophister with cheerful hope thus he accosted her fair creature let me speak without offence i would my rude words had the influence to lead thy thoughts as thy fair looks do mine then shouldst thou be his prisoner who is thine be not unkind and fair misshapen stuff are of behaviour boisterous and rough o shun me not but hear me ere you go god knows i cannot force love as you do my words shall be as spotless as my youth full of simplicity and naked truth this sacrifice whose sweet perfume descending from venus altar to your footsteps bending doth testify that you exceed her far to whom you offer and whose nun you are why should you worship her her you surpass as much as sparkling diamonds flaring glass a diamond set in lead his worth retains a heavenly nymph beloved of human swains receives no blemish but ofttimes more grace which makes me hope although i am but base base in respect of thee divine and pure dutiful service may thy love procure and i in duty will excel all other as thou in beauty dost exceed loves mother nor heaven nor thou were made to gaze upon as heaven preserves all things so save thou one a stately builded ship well rigged and tall the ocean maketh more majestical why vowest thou then to live in sestos here who on loves seas more glorious wouldst appear like untuned golden strings all women are which long time lie untouched will harshly jar vessels of brass oft handled brightly shine what difference betwixt the richest mine and basest mould but use for both not used are of like worth then treasure is abused when misers keep it being put to loan in time it will return us two for one rich robes themselves and others do adorn neither themselves nor others if not worn who builds a palace and rams up the gate shall see it ruinous and desolate ah simple hero learn thyself to cherish lone women like to empty houses perish less sins the poor rich man that starves himself in heaping up a mass of drossy pelf than such as you his golden earth remains which after his decease some other gains but this fair gem sweet in the loss alone when you fleet hence can be bequeathed to none or if it could down from thenameled sky all heaven would come to claim this legacy and with intestine broils the world destroy and quite confound natures sweet harmony well therefore by the gods decreed it is we human creatures should enjoy that bliss one is no number maids are nothing then without the sweet society of men wilt thou live single still one shalt thou be though never singling hymen couple thee wild savages that drink of running springs think water far excels all earthly things but they that daily taste neat wine despise it virginity albeit some highly prize it compared with marriage had you tried them both differs as much as wine and water doth base bullion for the stamps sake we allow even so for mens impression do we you by which alone our reverend fathers say women receive perfection every way this idol which you term virginity is neither essence subject to the eye no nor to any one exterior sense nor hath it any place of residence nor ist of earth or mould celestial or capable of any form at all of that which hath no being do not boast things that are not at all are never lost men foolishly do call it virtuous what virtue is it that is born with us much less can honour be ascribed thereto honour is purchased by the deeds we do believe me hero honour is not won until some honourable deed be done seek you for chastity immortal fame and know that some have wronged dianas name whose name is it if she be false or not so she be fair but some vile tongues will blot but you are fair ay me so wondrous fair so young so gentle and so debonair as greece will think if thus you live alone some one or other keeps you as his own then hero hate me not nor from me fly to follow swiftly blasting infamy perhaps thy sacred priesthood makes thee loath tell me to whom madst thou that heedless oath to venus answered she and as she spake forth from those two tralucent cisterns brake a stream of liquid pearl which down her face made milkwhite paths whereon the gods might trace to joves high court he thus replied the rites in which loves beauteous empress most delights are banquets doric music midnight revel plays masks and all that stern age counteth evil thee as a holy idiot doth she scorn for thou in vowing chastity hast sworn to rob her name and honour and thereby committst a sin far worse than

heart and hands so pure so innocent nay such as might have made heaven stoop to have a touch did she uphold to venus and again vowed spotless chastity but all in vain cupid beats down her prayers with his wings her vows above the empty air he flings all deep enraged his sinewy bow he bent and shot a shaft that burning from him went wherewith she strooken looked so dolefully as made love sigh to see his tyranny and as she wept her tears to pearl he turned and wound them on his arm and for her mourned then towards the palace of the destinies laden with languishment and grief he flies and to those

country maid whose careless hair instead of pearl tadorn it glistered with dew as one that seemed to scorn it her breath as fragrant as the morning rose her mind pure and her tongue untaught to gloze yet proud she was for lofty pride that dwells in towered courts is oft in shepherds cells and too too well the fair vermilion knew and silver tincture of her cheeks that drew the love of every swain on her this god enamoured was and with his snaky rod did charm her nimble feet and made her stay the while upon a hillock down he lay and sweetly on his pipe began to play and with smooth speech her fancy to assay till in his twining arms he locked her fast and then he wooed with kisses and at last as shepherds do her on the ground he laid and tumbling in the grass he often strayed beyond the bounds of shame in being bold to eye those parts which no eye should behold and like an insolent commanding lover boasting his parentage would needs discover the way to new elysium but she whose only dower was her chastity having strivn in vain was now about to cry and crave the help of shepherds that were nigh herewith he stayed his fury and began to give her leave to rise away she ran after went mercury who used such cunning as she to hear his tale left off her running maids are not won by brutish force and might but speeches full of pleasure and delight and knowing hermes courted her was glad that she such loveliness and beauty had as could provoke his liking yet was mute and neither would deny nor grant his suit still vowed he love she wanting no excuse to feed him with delays as women use or thirsting after immortality all women are ambitious naturally imposed upon her lover such a task as he ought not perform nor yet she ask a draught of flowing nectar she requested wherewith the king of gods and men is feasted he ready to accomplish what she willed stole some from hebe hebe joves cup filled and gave it to his simple rustic love which being known as what is hid

began their golden reign murder rape war lust and treachery were with jove closed in stygian empery but long this blessed time continued not as soon as he his wished purpose got he reckless of his

full often looked behind and many poor excuses did she find to linger by the way and once she stayed and would have turned again but was afraid in offering parley to be counted light so on she goes and in her idle flight her painted fan of curled plumes let fall thinking to train leander therewithal he being a novice knew not what she meant but stayed and after her a letter sent which joyful hero answered in such sort as he had hope to scale the beauteous fort wherein the liberal graces locked their wealth and therefore to her tower he got by stealth wide open stood the door he need not climb and she herself before the pointed time had spread the board with roses strowed the room and oft looked out and mused he did not come at last he came o who can tell the greeting these greedy lovers had at their first meeting he asked she gave and nothing was denied both to each other quickly were affied look how their hands so were their hearts united and what he did she willingly requited sweet are the kisses the embracements sweet when like desires and affections meet for from the earth to heaven is cupid raised where fancy is in equal balance peised yet she this rashness suddenly repented and turned aside and to herself lamented as if her name and honour had been wronged by being possessed of him for whom she longed ay and she wished albeit not from her heart that he would leave her turret and depart the mirthful god of amorous pleasure smiled to see how he this captive nymph beguiled for hitherto he did but fan the fire and kept it down that it might mount the higher now waxed she jealous lest his love abated fearing her own thoughts made her to be hated therefore unto him hastily she goes and like light salmacis her body throws upon his bosom where with yielding eyes she offers up herself a sacrifice to slake his anger if he were displeased o what god would not therewith be appeased like aesops cock this jewel he enjoyed and as a brother with his sister toyed supposing nothing else was to be done now he her favour and good will had won but know you not that creatures wanting sense by nature have a mutual appetence and wanting organs to advance a step moved by loves force unto each other lep much more in subjects having intellect some hidden influence breeds like effect albeit leander rude in love and raw long dallying with hero nothing saw that might delight him more yet he suspected some amorous rites or other were neglected therefore unto his body hers he clung she fearing on the rushes to be flung strived with redoubled strength the more she strived the more a gentle pleasing heat revived which taught him all that elder lovers know and now the same gan so to scorch and glow as in plain terms yet cunningly he craved it love always makes those eloquent that have it she with a kind of granting put him by it and ever as he thought himself most nigh it like to the tree of tantalus she fled and seeming lavish saved her maidenhead neer king more sought to keep his diadem than hero this inestimable gem above our life we love a steadfast friend yet when a token of great worth we send we often kiss it often look thereon and stay the messenger that would be gone no marvel then though hero would not yield so soon to part from that she dearly held jewels being lost are found again this never tis lost but once and once lost lost forever now had the morn espied her lovers steeds whereat she starts puts on her purple weeds and red for anger that he stayed so long all headlong throws herself the clouds among and now leander fearing to be missed embraced her suddenly took leave and kissed long was he taking leave and loath to go and kissed again as lovers use to do sad hero wrung him by the hand and wept saying let your vows and promises be kept then standing at the door she turned about as loath to see leander going out and now the sun that through th horizon peeps as pitying these lovers downward creeps so that in silence of the cloudy night though it was morning did he take his flight but what the secret trusty night concealed leanders amorous habit soon revealed with cupids myrtle was his bonnet crowned about his arms the purple riband wound wherewith she wreathed her largely spreading hair nor could the youth abstain but he must wear the sacred ring wherewith she was endowed when first religious chastity she vowed which made his love through sestos to be known and thence unto abydos sooner blown than he could sail for incorporeal fame whose weight consists in nothing but her name is swifter than the wind whose tardy plumes are reeking water and dull earthly fumes home when he came he seemed not to be there but like exiled air thrust from his sphere set in a foreign place and straight from thence alcides like by mighty violence he would have chased away the swelling main that him from her unjustly did detain like as the sun in a diameter fires and inflames objects removed far and heateth kindly shining laterally so beauty sweetly quickens when tis nigh but being separated and removed burns where it cherished murders where it loved therefore even as an index to a book so to his mind was young leanders look o none but gods have power their love to hide affection by the countenance is descried the light of hidden fire itself discovers and love that is concealed betrays poor lovers his secret flame apparently was seen leanders father knew where he had been and for the same mildly rebuked his son thinking to quench the sparkles new begun but love resisted once grows passionate and nothing more than counsel lovers hate for as a hot proud horse highly disdains to have his head controlled but breaks the reins spits forth the ringled bit and with his hooves checks the submissive ground so he that loves the more he is restrained the worse he fares what is it now but mad leander dares o hero hero thus he cried full oft and then he got him to a rock aloft where having spied her tower long stared he ont and prayed the narrow toiling hellespont to part in twain that he might come and go but still the rising billows answered no with that he stripped him to the ivory skin and crying love i come leaped lively in whereat the sapphire visaged god grew proud and made his capering triton sound aloud imagining that ganymede displeased had left the heavens therefore on him he seized leander strived the waves about him wound and pulled him to the bottom where the ground was strewed with pearl and in low coral groves sweet singing mermaids sported with their loves on heaps of heavy gold and took great pleasure to spurn in careless sort the shipwrack treasure for here the stately azure palace stood where kingly neptune and his train abode the lusty god embraced him called him love and swore he never should return to jove but when he knew it was not ganymede for under water he was almost dead he heaved him up and looking on his face beat down the bold waves with his triple mace which mounted up intending to have kissed him and fell in drops like tears because they missed him leander being up began to swim and looking back saw neptune follow him whereat aghast the poor soul gan to cry o let me visit hero ere i die the god put helles bracelet on his arm and swore the sea should never do him harm he clapped his plump cheeks with his tresses played and smiling wantonly his love bewrayed he watched his arms and as they opened wide at every stroke betwixt them would he slide and steal a kiss and then run out and dance and as he turned cast many a lustful glance and threw him gaudy toys to please his eye and dive into the water and there pry upon his breast his thighs and every limb and up again and close beside him swim and talk of love leander made reply you are deceived i am no woman i thereat smiled neptune and then told a tale how that a shepherd sitting in a vale played with a boy so fair and kind as for his love both earth and heaven pined that of the cooling river durst not drink lest water nymphs should pull him from the brink and when he sported in the fragrant lawns goat footed satyrs and upstaring fauns would steal him thence ere half this tale was done ay me leander cried th enamoured sun that now should shine on thetis glassy bower descends upon my radiant heros tower o that these tardy arms of mine were wings and as he spake upon the waves he springs neptune was angry that he gave no ear and in his heart revenging malice bare he flung at him his mace but as it went he called it in for love made him repent the mace returning back his own hand hit as meaning to be venged for darting it when this fresh bleeding wound leander viewed his colour went and came as if he rued the grief which neptune felt in gentle breasts relenting thoughts remorse and pity rests and who have hard hearts and obdurate minds but vicious harebrained and illiterate hinds the god seeing him with pity to be moved thereon concluded that he was beloved love is too full of faith too credulous with folly and false hope deluding us wherefore leanders fancy to surprise to the rich ocean for gifts he flies tis wisdom to give much a gift prevails when deep persuading oratory fails by this leander being near the land cast down his weary feet and felt the sand breathless albeit he were he rested not till to the solitary tower he got and knocked and called at which celestial noise the longing heart of hero much more joys than nymphs and shepherds when the timbrel rings or crooked dolphin when the sailor sings she stayed not for her robes but straight arose and drunk with gladness to the door she goes where seeing a naked man she screeched for fear such sights as this to tender maids are rare and ran into the dark herself to hide rich jewels in the dark are soonest spied unto her was he led or rather drawn by those white limbs which sparkled through the lawn the nearer that he came the more she fled and seeking refuge slipped into her bed whereon leander sitting thus began through numbing cold all feeble faint and wan if not for love yet love for pity sake me in thy bed and maiden bosom take at least vouchsafe these arms some little room who hoping to embrace thee cheerly swum this head was beat with many a churlish billow and therefore let it rest upon thy pillow herewith affrighted hero shrunk away and in her lukewarm place leander lay whose lively heat like fire from heaven fet would animate gross clay and higher set the drooping thoughts of base declining souls than dreary mars carousing nectar bowls his hands he cast upon her like a snare she overcome with shame and sallow fear like chaste diana when actaeon spied her being suddenly betrayed dived down to hide her and as her silver body downward went with both her hands she made the bed a tent and in her own mind thought herself secure oercast with dim and darksome coverture and now she lets him whisper in her ear flatter entreat promise protest and swear yet ever as he greedily assayed to touch those dainties she the harpy played and every limb did as a soldier stout defend the fort and keep the foeman out for though the rising ivory mount he scaled which is with azure circling lines empaled much like a globe a globe may i term this by which love sails to regions full of bliss yet there with sisyphus he toiled in vain till gentle parley did the truce obtain wherein leander on her quivering breast breathless spoke something and sighed out the rest which so prevailed as he with small ado enclosed her in his arms and kissed her too and every kiss to her was as a charm and to leander as a fresh alarm so that the truce was broke and she alas poor silly maiden at his mercy was love is not full of pity as men say but deaf and cruel where he means to prey even as a bird which in our hands we wring forth plungeth and oft flutters with her wing she trembling strove this strife of hers like that which made the world another world begat of unknown joy treason was in her thought and cunningly to yield herself she sought seeming not won yet won she was at length in such wars women use but half their strength leander now like theban hercules entered the orchard of th hesperides whose fruit none rightly can describe but he that pulls or shakes it from the golden tree and now she wished this night were never done and sighed to think upon th approaching sun for much it grieved her that the bright daylight should know the pleasure of this blessed night and them like mars and erycine display both in each others arms chained as they lay again she knew not how to frame her look or speak to him who in a moment took that which so long so charily she kept and fain by stealth away she would have crept and to some corner secretly have gone leaving leander in the bed alone but as her naked feet were whipping out he on the sudden clinged her so about that mermaidlike unto the floor she slid one half appeared the other half was hid thus near the bed she blushing stood upright and from her countenance behold ye might a kind of twilight break which through the hair as from an orient cloud glimpsed here and there and round about the chamber this false morn brought forth the day before the day was born so heros ruddy cheek hero betrayed and her all naked to his sight displayed whence his admiring eyes more pleasure took than dis on heaps of gold fixing his look by this apollos golden harp began to sound forth music to the ocean which watchful hesperus no sooner heard but he the bright daybearing car

       " 'i man being the servant and interpreter of nature can do and understand so much and so much only as he has observed in fact or in thought of the course of nature beyond this he neither knows anything nor can do anything ii neither the naked hand nor the understanding left to itself can effect much it is by instruments and helps that the work is done which are as much wanted for the understanding as for the hand and as the instruments of the hand either give motion or guide it so the instruments of the mind supply either suggestions for the understanding or cautions iii human knowledge and human power meet in one for where the cause is not known the effect cannot be produced nature to be commanded must be obeyed and that which in contemplation is as the cause is in operation as the rule iv towards the effecting of works all that man can do is to put together or put asunder natural bodies the rest is done by nature working within v the study of nature with a view to works is engaged in by the mechanic the mathematician the physician the alchemist and the magician but by all as things now are with slight endeavour and scanty success vi it would be an unsound fancy and selfcontradictory to expect that things which have never yet been done can be done except by means which have never yet been tried vii the productions of the mind and hand seem very numerous in books and manufactures but all this variety lies in an exquisite subtlety and derivations from a few things already known not in the number of axioms viii moreover the works already known are due to chance and experiment rather than to sciences for the sciences we now possess are merely systems for the nice ordering and setting forth of things already invented not methods of invention or directions for new works ix the cause and root of nearly all evils in the sciences is this — that while we falsely admire and extol the powers of the human mind we neglect to seek for its true helps x the subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of the senses and understanding so that all those specious meditations speculations and glosses in which men indulge are quite from the purpose only there is no one by to observe it xi as the sciences which we now have do not help us in finding out new works so neither does the logic which we now have help us in finding out new sciences xii the logic now in use serves rather to fix and give stability to the errors which have their foundation in commonly received notions than to help the search after truth so it does more harm than good xiii the syllogism is not applied to the first principles of sciences and is applied in vain to intermediate axioms being no match for the subtlety of nature it commands assent therefore to the proposition but does not take hold of the thing xiv the syllogism consists of propositions propositions consist of words words are symbols of notions therefore if the notions themselves which is the root of the matter are confused and overhastily abstracted from the facts there can be no firmness in the superstructure our only hope therefore lies in a true induction xv there is no soundness in our notions whether logical or physical substance quality action passion essence itself are not sound notions much less are heavy light dense rare moist dry generation corruption attraction repulsion element matter form and the like but all are fantastical and ill defined xvi our notions of less general species as man dog dove and of the immediate perceptions of the sense as hot cold black white do not materially mislead us yet even these are sometimes confused by the flux and alteration of matter and the mixing of one thing with another all the others which men have hitherto adopted are but wanderings not being abstracted and formed from things by proper methods xvii nor is there less of wilfulness and wandering in the construction of axioms than in the formations of notions not excepting even those very principles which are obtained by common induction but much more in the axioms and lower propositions educed by the syllogism xviii the discoveries which have hitherto been made in the sciences are such as lie close to vulgar notions scarcely beneath the surface in order to penetrate into the inner and further recesses of nature it is necessary that both notions and axioms be derived from things by a more sure and guarded way and that a method of intellectual operation be introduced altogether better and more certain xix there are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth the one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms and from these principles the truth of which it takes for settled and immovable proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of middle axioms and this way is now in fashion the other derives axioms from the senses and particulars rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all this is the true way but as yet untried xx the understanding left to itself takes the same course namely the former which it takes in accordance with logical order for the mind longs to spring up to positions of higher generality that it may find rest there and so after a little while wearies of experiment but this evil is increased by logic because of the order and solemnity of its disputations xxi the understanding left to itself in a sober patient and grave mind especially if it be not hindered by received doctrines tries a little that other way which is the right one but with little progress since the understanding unless directed and assisted is a thing unequal and quite unfit to contend with the obscurity of things xxii both ways set out from the senses and particulars and rest in the highest generalities but the difference between them is infinite for the one just glances at experiment and particulars in passing the other dwells duly and orderly among them the one again begins at once by establishing certain abstract and useless generalities the other rises by gradual steps to that which is prior and better known in the order of nature xxiii there is a great difference between the idols of the human mind and the ideas of the divine that is to say between certain empty dogmas and the true signatures and marks set upon the works of creation as they are found in nature xxiv it cannot be that axioms established by argumentation should avail for the discovery of new works since the subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of argument but axioms duly and orderly formed from particulars easily discover the way to new particulars and thus render sciences active xxv the axioms now in use having been suggested by a scanty and manipular experience and a few particulars of most general occurrence are made for the most part just large enough to fit and take these in and therefore it is no wonder if they do not lead to new particulars and if some opposite instance not observed or not known before chance to come in the way the axiom is rescued and preserved by some frivolous distinction whereas the truer course would be to correct the axiom itself xxvi the conclusions of human reason as ordinarily applied in matter of nature i call for the sake of distinction anticipations of nature as a thing rash or premature that reason which is elicited from facts by a just and methodical process i call interpretation of nature xxvii anticipations are a ground sufficiently firm for consent for even if men went mad all after the same fashion they might agree one with another well enough xxviii for the winning of assent indeed anticipations are far more powerful than interpretations because being collected from a few instances and those for the most part of familiar occurrence they straightway touch the understanding and fill the imagination whereas interpretations on the other hand being gathered here and there from very various and widely dispersed facts cannot suddenly strike the understanding and therefore they must needs in respect of the opinions of the time seem harsh and out of tune much as the mysteries of faith do xxix in sciences founded on opinions and dogmas the use of anticipations and logic is good for in them the object is to command assent to the proposition not to master the thing xxx though all the wits of all the ages should meet together and combine and transmit their labours yet will no great progress ever be made in science by means of anticipations because radical errors in the first concoction of the mind are not to be cured by the excellence of functions and remedies subsequent xxxi it is idle to expect any great advancement in science from the superinducing and engrafting of new things upon old we must begin anew from the very foundations unless we would revolve for ever in a circle with mean and contemptible progress xxxii the honour of the ancient authors and indeed of all remains untouched since the comparison i challenge is not of wits or faculties but of ways and methods and the part i take upon myself is not that of a judge but of a guide xxxiii this must be plainly avowed no judgment can be rightly formed either of my method or of the discoveries to which it leads by means of anticipations that is to say of the reasoning which is now in use since i cannot be called on to abide by the sentence of a tribunal which is itself on its trial xxxiv even to deliver and explain what i bring forward is no easy matter for things in themselves new will yet be apprehended with reference to what is old xxxv it was said by borgia of the expedition of the french into italy that they came with chalk in their hands to mark out their lodgings not with arms to force their way in i in like manner would have my doctrine enter quietly into the minds that are fit and capable of receiving it for confutations cannot be employed when the difference is upon first principles and very notions and even upon forms of demonstration xxxvi one method of delivery alone remains to us which is simply this we must lead men to the particulars themselves and their series and order while men on their side must force themselves for awhile to lay their notions by and begin to familiarise themselves with facts xxxvii the doctrine of those who have denied that certainty could be attained at all has some agreement with my way of proceeding at the first setting out but they end in being infinitely separated and opposed for the holders of that doctrine assert simply that nothing can be known i also assert that not much can be known in nature by the way which is now in use but then they go on to destroy the authority of the senses and understanding whereas i proceed to devise and supply helps for the same xxxviii the idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding and have taken deep root therein not only so beset mens minds that truth can hardly find entrance but even after entrance obtained they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults xxxix there are four classes of idols which beset mens minds to these for distinctions sake i have assigned names — calling the first class idols of the tribe the second idols of the cave the third idols of the marketplace the fourth idols of the theatre xl the formation of ideas and axioms by true induction is no doubt the proper remedy to be applied for the keeping off and clearing away of idols to point them out however is of great use for the doctrine of idols is to the interpretation of nature what the doctrine of the refutation of sophisms is to common logic xli the idols of the tribe have their foundation in human nature itself and in the tribe or race of men for it is a false assertion that the sense of man is the measure of things on the contrary all perceptions as well of the sense as of the mind are according to the measure of the individual and not according to the measure of the universe and the human understanding is like a false mirror which receiving rays irregularly distorts and discolours the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it xlii the idols of the cave are the idols of the individual man for every one besides the errors common to human nature in general has a cave or den of his own which refracts and discolours the light of nature owing either to his own proper and peculiar nature or to his education and conversation with others or to the reading of books and the authority of those whom he esteems and admires or to the differences of impressions accordingly as they take place in a mind preoccupied and predisposed or in a mind indifferent and settled or the like so that the spirit of man according as it is meted out to different individuals is in fact a thing variable and full of perturbation and governed as it were by chance whence it was well observed by heraclitus that men look for sciences in their own lesser worlds and not in the greater or common world xliii there are also idols formed by the intercourse and association of men with each other which i call idols of the marketplace on account of the commerce and consort of men there for it is by discourse that men associate and words are imposed according to the apprehension of the vulgar and therefore the ill and unfit choice of words wonderfully obstructs the understanding nor do the definitions or explanations wherewith in some things learned men are wont to guard and defend themselves by any means set the matter right but words plainly force and overrule the understanding and throw all into confusion and lead men away into numberless empty controversies and idle fancies xliv lastly there are idols which have immigrated into mens minds from the various dogmas of philosophies and also from wrong laws of demonstration these i call idols of the theatre because in my judgment all the received systems are but so many stageplays representing worlds of their own creation after an unreal and scenic fashion nor is it only of the systems now in vogue or only of the ancient sects and philosophies that i speak for many more plays of the same kind may yet be composed and in like artificial manner set forth seeing that errors the most widely different have nevertheless causes for the most part alike neither again do i mean this only of entire systems but also of many principles and axioms in science which by tradition credulity and negligence have come to be received but of these several kinds of idols i must speak more largely and exactly that the understanding may be duly cautioned xlv the human understanding is of its own nature prone to suppose the existence of more order and regularity in the world than it finds and though there be many things in nature which are singular and unmatched yet it devises for them parallels and conjugates and relatives which do not exist hence the fiction that all celestial bodies move in perfect circles spirals and dragons being except in name utterly rejected hence too the element of fire with its orb is brought in to make up the square with the other three which the sense perceives hence also the ratio of density of the socalled elements is arbitrarily fixed at ten to one and so on of other dreams and these fancies affect not dogmas only but simple notions also xlvi the human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself draws all things else to support and agree with it and though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side yet these it either neglects and despises or else by some distinction sets aside and rejects in order that by this great and pernicious predetermination the authority of its former conclusions may remain inviolate and therefore it was a good answer that was made by one who when they showed him hanging in a temple a picture of those who had paid their vows as having escaped shipwreck and would have him say whether he did not now acknowledge the power of the gods — aye asked he again but where are they painted that were drowned after their vows and such is the way of all superstition whether in astrology dreams omens divine judgments or the like wherein men having a delight in such vanities mark the events where they are fulfilled but where they fail though this happen much oftener neglect and pass them by but with far more subtlety does this mischief insinuate itself into philosophy and the sciences in which the first conclusion colours and brings into conformity with itself all that come after though far sounder and better besides independently of that delight and vanity which i have described it is the peculiar and perpetual error of the human intellect to be more moved and excited by affirmatives than by negatives whereas it ought properly to hold itself indifferently disposed towards both alike indeed in the establishment of any true axiom the negative instance is the more forcible of the two xlvii the human understanding is moved by those things most which strike and enter the mind simultaneously and suddenly and so fill the imagination and then it feigns and supposes all other things to be somehow though it cannot see how similar to those few things by which it is surrounded but for that going to and fro to remote and heterogeneous instances by which axioms are tried as in the fire the intellect is altogether slow and unfit unless it be forced thereto by severe laws and overruling authority xlviii the human understanding is unquiet it cannot stop or rest and still presses onward but in vain therefore it is that we cannot conceive of any end or limit to the world but always as of necessity it occurs to us that there is something beyond neither again can it be conceived how eternity has flowed down to the present day for that distinction which is commonly received of infinity in time past and in time to come can by no means hold for it would thence follow that one infinity is greater than another and that infinity is wasting away and tending to become finite the like subtlety arises touching the infinite divisibility of lines from the same inability of thought to stop but this inability interferes more mischievously in the discovery of causes for although the most general principles in nature ought to be held merely positive as they are discovered and cannot with truth be referred to a cause nevertheless the human understanding being unable to rest still seeks something prior in the order of nature and then it is that in struggling towards that which is further off it falls back upon that which is more nigh at hand namely on final causes which have relation clearly to the nature of man rather than to the nature of the universe and from this source have strangely defiled philosophy but he is no less an unskilled and shallow philosopher who seeks causes of that which is most general than he who in things subordinate and subaltern omits to do so xlix the human understanding is no dry light but receives an infusion from the will and affections whence proceed sciences which may be called sciences as one would for what a man had rather were true he more readily believes therefore he rejects difficult things from impatience of research sober things because they narrow hope the deeper things of nature from superstition the light of experience from arrogance and pride lest his mind should seem to be occupied with things mean and transitory things not commonly believed out of deference to the opinion of the vulgar numberless in short are the ways and sometimes imperceptible in which the affections colour and infect the understanding l but by far the greatest hindrance and aberration of the human understanding proceeds from the dullness incompetency and deceptions of the senses in that things which strike the sense outweigh things which do not immediately strike it though they be more important hence it is that speculation commonly ceases where sight ceases insomuch that of things invisible there is little or no observation hence all the working of the spirits inclosed in tangible bodies lies hid and unobserved of men so also all the more subtle changes of form in the parts of coarser substances which they commonly call alteration though it is in truth local motion through exceedingly small spaces is in like manner unobserved and yet unless these two things just mentioned be searched out and brought to light nothing great can be achieved in nature as far as the production of works is concerned so again the essential nature of our common air and of all bodies less dense than air which are very many is almost unknown for the sense by itself is a thing infirm and erring neither can instruments for enlarging or sharpening the senses do much but all the truer kind of interpretation of nature is effected by instances and experiments fit and apposite wherein the sense decides touching the experiment only and the experiment touching the point in nature and the thing itself li the human understanding is of its own nature prone to abstractions and gives a substance and reality to things which are fleeting but to resolve nature into abstractions is less to our purpose than to dissect her into parts as did the school of democritus which went further into nature than the rest matter rather than forms should be the object of our attention its configurations and changes of configuration and simple action and law of action or motion for forms are figments of the human mind unless you will call those laws of action forms lii such then are the idols which i call idols of the tribe and which take their rise either from the homogeneity of the substance of the human spirit or from its preoccupation or from its narrowness or from its restless motion or from an infusion of the affections or from the incompetency of the senses or from the mode of impression liii the idols of the cave take their rise in the peculiar constitution mental or bodily of each individual and also in education habit and accident of this kind there is a great number and variety but i will instance those the pointing out of which contains the most important caution and which have most effect in disturbing the clearness of the understanding liv men become attached to certain particular sciences and speculations either because they fancy themselves the authors and inventors thereof or because they have bestowed the greatest pains upon them and become most habituated to them but men of this kind if they betake themselves to philosophy and contemplations of a general character distort and colour them in obedience to their former fancies a thing especially to be noticed in aristotle who made his natural philosophy a mere bondservant to his logic thereby rendering it contentious and well nigh useless the race of chemists again out of a few experiments of the furnace have built up a fantastic philosophy framed with reference to a few things and gilbert also after he had employed himself most laboriously in the study and observation of the loadstone proceeded at once to construct an entire system in accordance with his favourite subject lv there is one principal and as it were radical distinction between different minds in respect of philosophy and the sciences which is this that some minds are stronger and apter to mark the differences of things others to mark their resemblances the steady and acute mind can fix its contemplations and dwell and fasten on the subtlest distinctions the lofty and discursive mind recognises and puts together the finest and most general resemblances both kinds however easily err in excess by catching the one at gradations the other at shadows lvi there are found some minds given to an extreme admiration of antiquity others to an extreme love and appetite for novelty but few so duly tempered that they can hold the mean neither carping at what has been well laid down by the ancients nor despising what is well introduced by the moderns this however turns to the great injury of the sciences and philosophy since these affectations of antiquity and novelty are the humours of partisans rather than judgments and truth is to be sought for not in the felicity of any age which is an unstable thing but in the light of nature and experience which is eternal these factions therefore must be abjured and care must be taken that the intellect be not hurried by them into assent lvii contemplations of nature and of bodies in their simple form break up and distract the understanding while contemplations of nature and bodies in their composition and configuration overpower and dissolve the understanding a distinction well seen in the school of leucippus and democritus as compared with the other philosophies for that school is so busied with the particles that it hardly attends to the structure while the others are so lost in admiration of the structure that they do not penetrate to the simplicity of nature these kinds of contemplation should therefore be alternated and taken by turns that so the understanding may be rendered at once penetrating and comprehensive and the inconveniences above mentioned with the idols which proceed from them may be avoided lviii let such then be our provision and contemplative prudence for keeping off and dislodging the idols of the cave which grow for the most part either out of the predominance of a favourite subject or out of an excessive tendency to compare or to distinguish or out of partiality for particular ages or out of the largeness or minuteness of the objects contemplated and generally let every student of nature take this as a rule — that whatever his mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction is to be held in suspicion and that so much the more care is to be taken in dealing with such questions to keep the understanding even and clear lix but the idols of the marketplace are the most troublesome of all idols which have crept into the understanding through the alliances of words and names for men believe that their reason governs words but it is also true that words react on the understanding and this it is that has rendered philosophy and the sciences sophistical and inactive now words being commonly framed and applied according to the capacity of the vulgar follow those lines of division which are most obvious to the vulgar understanding and whenever an understanding of greater acuteness or a more diligent observation would alter those lines to suit the true divisions of nature words stand in the way and resist the change whence it comes to pass that the high and formal discussions of learned men end oftentimes in disputes about words and names with which according to the use and wisdom of the mathematicians it would be more prudent to begin and so by means of definitions reduce them to order yet even definitions cannot cure this evil in dealing with natural and material things since the definitions themselves consist of words and those words beget others so that it is necessary to recur to individual instances and those in due series and order as i shall say presently when i come to the method and scheme for the formation of notions and axioms lx the idols imposed by words on the understanding are of two kinds they are either names of things which do not exist for as there are things left unnamed through lack of observation so likewise are there names which result from fantastic suppositions and to which nothing in reality corresponds or they are names of things which exist but yet confused and illdefined and hastily and irregularly derived from realities of the former kind are fortune the prime mover planetary orbits element of fire and like fictions which owe their origin to false and idle theories and this class of idols is more easily expelled because to get rid of them it is only necessary that all theories should be steadily rejected and dismissed as obsolete but the other class which springs out of a faulty and unskilful abstraction is intricate and deeply rooted let us take for example such a word as humid and see how far the several things which the word is used to signify agree with each other and we shall find the word humid to be nothing else than a mark loosely and confusedly applied to denote a variety of actions which will not bear to be reduced to any constant meaning for it both signifies that which easily spreads itself round any other body and that which in itself is indeterminate and cannot solidise and that which readily yields in every direction and that which easily divides and scatters itself and that which easily unites and collects itself and that which readily flows and is put in motion and that which readily clings to another body and wets it and that which is easily reduced to a liquid or being solid easily melts accordingly when you come to apply the word — if you take it in one sense flame is humid if in another air is not humid if in another fine dust is humid if in another glass is humid so that it is easy to see that the notion is taken by abstraction only from water and common and ordinary liquids without any due verification there are however in words certain degrees of distortion and error one of the least faulty kinds is that of names of substances especially of lowest species and welldeduced for the notion of chalk and of mud is good of earth bad a more faulty kind is that of actions as to generate to corrupt to alter the most faulty is of qualities except such as are the immediate objects of the sense as heavy light rare dense and the like yet in all these cases some notions are of necessity a little better than others in proportion to the greater variety of subjects that fall within the range of the human sense lxi but the idols of the theatre are not innate nor do they steal into the understanding secretly but are plainly impressed and received into the mind from the playbooks of philosophical systems and the perverted rules of demonstration to attempt refutations in this case would be merely inconsistent with what i have already said for since we agree neither upon principles nor upon demonstrations there is no place for argument and this is so far well inasmuch as it leaves the honour of the ancients untouched for they are no wise disparaged the question between them and me being only as to the way for as the saying is the lame man who keeps the right road outstrips the runner who takes a wrong one nay it is obvious that when a man runs the wrong way the more active and swift he is the further he will go astray but the course i propose for the discovery of sciences is such as leaves but little to the acuteness and strength of wits but places all wits and understandings nearly on a level for as in the drawing of a straight line or a perfect circle much depends on the steadiness and practice of the hand if it be done by aim of hand only but if with the aid of rule or compass little or nothing so is it exactly with my plan but though particular confutations would be of no avail yet touching the sects and general divisions of such systems i must say something something also touching the external signs which show that they are unsound and finally something touching the causes of such great infelicity and of such lasting and general agreement in error that so the access to truth may be made less difficult and the human understanding may the more willingly submit to its purgation and dismiss its idols lxii idols of the theatre or of systems are many and there can be and perhaps will be yet many more for were it not that new for many ages mens minds have been busied with religion and theology and were it not that civil governments especially monarchies have been averse to such novelties even in matters speculative so that men labour therein to the peril and harming of their fortunes — not only unrewarded but exposed also to contempt and envy doubtless there would have arisen many other philosophical sects like to those which in great variety flourished once among the greeks for as on the phenomena of the heavens many hypotheses may be constructed so likewise and more also many various dogmas may be set up and established on the phenomena of philosophy and in the plays of this philosophical theatre you may observe the same thing which is found in the theatre of the poets that stories invented for the stage are more compact and elegant and more as one would wish them to be than true stories out of history in general however there is taken for the material of philosophy either a great deal out of a few things or a very little out of many things so that on both sides philosophy is based on too narrow a foundation of experiment and natural history and decides on the authority of too few cases for the rational school of philosophers snatches from experience a variety of common instances neither duly ascertained nor diligently examined and weighed and leaves all the rest to meditation and agitation of wit there is also another class of philosophers who having bestowed much diligent and careful labour on a few experiments have thence made bold to educe and construct systems wresting all other facts in a strange fashion to conformity therewith and there is yet a third class consisting of those who out of faith and veneration mix their philosophy with theology and traditions among whom the vanity of some has gone so far aside as to seek the origin of sciences among spirits and genii so that this parent stock of errors — this false philosophy — is of three kinds the sophistical the empirical and the superstitious lxiii the most conspicuous example of the first class was aristotle who corrupted natural philosophy by his logic fashioning the world out of categories assigning to the human soul the noblest of substances a genus from words of the second intention doing the business of density and rarity which is to make bodies of greater or less dimensions that is occupy greater or less spaces by the frigid distinction of act and power asserting that single bodies have each a single and proper motion and that if they participate in any other then this results from an external cause and imposing countless other arbitrary restrictions on the nature of things being always more solicitous to provide an answer to the question and affirm something positive in words than about the inner truth of things a failing best shown when his philosophy is compared with other systems of note among the greeks for the homoeomera of anaxagoras the atoms of leucippus and democritus the heaven and earth of parmenides the strife and friendship of empedocles heraclituss doctrine how bodies are resolved into the indifferent nature of fire and remoulded into solids have all of them some taste of the natural philosopher — some savour of the nature of things and experience and bodies whereas in the physics of aristotle you hear hardly anything but the words of logic which in his metaphysics also under a more imposing name and more forsooth as a realist than a nominalist he has handled over again nor let any weight be given to the fact that in his books on animals and his problems and other of his treatises there is frequent dealing with experiments for he had come to his conclusion before he did not consult experience as he should have done in order to the framing of his decisions and axioms but having first determined the question according to his will he then resorts to experience and bending her into conformity with his placets leads her about like a captive in a procession so that even on this count he is more guilty than his modern followers the schoolmen who have abandoned experience altogether lxiv but the empirical school of philosophy gives birth to dogmas more deformed and monstrous than the sophistical or rational school for it has its foundations not in the light of common notions which though it be a faint and superficial light is yet in a manner universal and has reference to many things but in the narrowness and darkness of a few experiments to those therefore who are daily busied with these experiments and have infected their imagination with them such a philosophy seems probable and all but certain to all men else incredible and vain of this there is a notable instance in the alchemists and their dogmas though it is hardly to be found elsewhere in these times except perhaps in the philosophy of gilbert nevertheless with regard to philosophies of this kind there is one caution not to be omitted for i foresee that if ever men are roused by my admonitions to betake themselves seriously to experiment and bid farewell to sophistical doctrines then indeed through the premature hurry of the understanding to leap or fly to universals and principles of things great danger may be apprehended from philosophies of this kind against which evil we ought even now to prepare lxv but the corruption of philosophy by superstition and an admixture of theology is far more widely spread and does the greatest harm whether to entire systems or to their parts for the human understanding is obnoxious to the influence of the imagination no less than to the influence of common notions for the contentious and sophistical kind of philosophy ensnares the understanding but this kind being fanciful and timid and half poetical misleads it more by flattery for there is in man an ambition of the understanding no less than of the will especially in high and lofty spirits of this kind we have among the greeks a striking example in pythagoras though he united with it a coarser and more cumbrous superstition another in plato and his school more dangerous and subtle it shows itself likewise in parts of other philosophies in the introduction of abstract forms and final causes and first causes with the omission in most cases of causes intermediate and the like upon this point the greatest caution should be used for nothing is so mischievous as the apotheosis of error and it is a very plague of the understanding for vanity to become the object of veneration yet in this vanity some of the moderns have with extreme levity indulged so far as to attempt to found a system of natural philosophy on the first chapter of genesis on the book of job and other parts of the sacred writings seeking for the dead among the living which also makes the inhibition and repression of it the more important because from this unwholesome mixture of things human and divine there arises not only a fantastic philosophy but also an heretical religion very meet it is therefore that we be soberminded and give to faith that only which is faiths lxvi so much then for the mischievous authorities of systems which are founded either on common notions or on a few experiments or on superstition it remains to speak of the faulty subjectmatter of contemplations especially in natural philosophy now the human understanding is infected by the sight of what takes place in the mechanical arts in which the alteration of bodies proceeds chiefly by composition or separation and so imagines that something similar goes on in the universal nature of things from this source has flowed the fiction of elements and of their concourse for the formation of natural bodies again when man contemplates nature working freely he meets with different species of things of animals of plants of minerals whence he readily passes into the opinion that there are in nature certain primary forms which nature intends to educe and that the remaining variety proceeds from hindrances and aberrations of nature in the fulfilment of her work or from the collision of different species and the transplanting of one into another to the first of these speculations we owe our primary qualities of the elements to the other our occult properties and specific virtues and both of them belong to those empty compendia of thought wherein the mind rests and whereby it is diverted from more solid pursuits it is to better purpose that the physicians bestow their labour on the secondary qualities of matter and the operations of attraction repulsion attenuation conspissation dilatation astriction dissipation maturation and the like and were it not that by those two compendia which i have mentioned elementary qualities to wit and specific virtues they corrupted their correct observations in these other matters — either reducing them to first qualities and their subtle and incommensurable mixtures or not following them out with greater and more diligent observation to third and fourth qualities but breaking off the scrutiny prematurely — they had made much greater progress nor are powers of this kind i do not say the same but similar to be sought for only in the medicines of the human body but also in the changes of all other bodies but it is a far greater evil that they make the quiescent principles wherefrom and not the moving principles whereby things are produced the object of their contemplation and inquiry for the former tend to discourse the latter to works nor is there any value in those vulgar distinctions of motion which are observed in the received system of natural philosophy as generation corruption augmentation diminution alteration and local motion what they mean no doubt is this — if a body in other respects not changed be moved from its place this is local motion if without change of place or essence it be changed in quality this is alteration if by reason of the change the mass and quantity of the body do not remain the same this is augmentation or diminution if they be changed to such a degree that they change their very essence and substance and turn to something else this is generation and corruption but all this is merely popular and does not at all go deep into nature for these are only measures and limits not kinds of motion what they intimate is how far not by what means or from what source for they do not suggest anything with regard either to the desires of bodies or to the development of their parts it is only when that motion presents the thing grossly and palpably to the sense as different from what it was that they begin to mark the division even when they wish to suggest something with regard to the causes of motion and to establish a division with reference to them they introduce with the greatest negligence a distinction between motion natural and violent a distinction which is itself drawn entirely from a vulgar notion since all violent motion is also in fact natural the external efficient simply setting nature working otherwise than it was before but if leaving all this any one shall observe for instance that there is in bodies a desire of mutual contact so as not to suffer the unity of nature to be quite separated or broken and a vacuum thus made or if any one say that there is in bodies a desire of resuming their natural dimensions or tension so that if compressed within or extended beyond them they immediately strive to recover themselves and fall back to their old volume and extent or if any one say that there is in bodies a desire of congregating towards masses of kindred nature — of dense bodies for instance towards the globe of the earth of thin and rare bodies towards the compass of the sky all these and the like are truly physical kinds of motion — but those others are entirely logical and scholastic as is abundantly manifest from this comparison nor again is it a less evil that in their philosophies and contemplations their labour is spent in investigating and handling the first principles of things and the highest generalities of nature whereas utility and the means of working result entirely from things intermediate hence it is that men cease not from abstracting nature till they come to potential and uninformed matter nor on the other hand from dissecting nature till they reach the atom things which even if true can do but little for the welfare of mankind lxvii a caution must also be given to the understanding against the intemperance which systems of philosophy manifest in giving or withholding assent because intemperance of this kind seems to establish idols and in some sort to perpetuate them leaving no way open to reach and dislodge them this excess is of two kinds the first being manifest in those who are ready in deciding and render sciences dogmatic and magisterial the other in those who deny that we can know anything and so introduce a wandering kind of inquiry that leads to nothing of which kinds the former subdues the latter weakens the understanding for the philosophy of aristotle after having by hostile confutations destroyed all the rest as the ottomans serve their brothers has laid down the law on all points which done he proceeds himself to raise new questions of his own suggestion and dispose of them likewise so that nothing may remain that is not certain and decided a practice which holds and is in use among his successors the school of plato on the other hand introduced acatalepsia at first in jest and irony and in disdain of the older sophists protagoras hippias and the rest who were of nothing else so much ashamed as of seeming to doubt about anything but the new academy made a dogma of it and held it as a tenet and though theirs is a fairer seeming way than arbitrary decisions since they say that they by no means destroy all investigation like pyrrho and his refrainers but allow of some things to be followed as probable though of none to be maintained as true yet still when the human mind has once despaired of finding truth its interest in all things grows fainter and the result is that men turn aside to pleasant disputations and discourses and roam as it were from object to object rather than keep on a course of severe inquisition but as i said at the beginning and am ever urging the human senses and understanding weak as they are are not to be deprived of their authority but to be supplied with helps lxviii so much concerning the several classes of idols and their equipage all of which must be renounced and put away with a fixed and solemn determination and the understanding thoroughly freed and cleansed the entrance into the kingdom of man founded on the sciences being not much other than the entrance into the kingdom of heaven whereinto none may enter except as a little child to cross the seas to any foreign soil peril and toil  wars with their noise affright us  when they cease we are worse in peace  — what then remains but that we still should cry for being born or

that i may write part of his glorious merit if he vouchsafe to guide my hand and quill to shew his death by which we doe inherit those endlesse joyes that all our hearts doe fill then will i tell of that sad blacke facd night whose mourning mantle covered heavenly light that very night our saviour was betrayed here begins oh night exceeding all the nights of sorow when our most blessed lord although dismayed yet would not he one minutes respite borrow but to mount olives went though sore afraid to welcome night and entertaine the morrow and as he oft unto that place did goe so did he now to meete his long nurst woe he told his deere disciples that they all should be offended by him that selfe night his griefe was great and theirs could not be small to part from him who was their sole delight saint peter thought his faith could never fall no mote could happen in so cleare a sight which made him say though all men were offended yet would he never though his life were ended but his deare lord made answere that before the cocke did crowe he should deny him thrice this could not choose but grieve him very sore that his hot love should proove more cold than ice denying him he did so much adore no imperfection in himselfe he spies but faith againe with him heel surely die rather than his deare master once denie and all the rest did likewise say the same of his disciples at that instant time but yet poore peter he was most too blame that thought above them all by faith to clime his forward speech inflicted sinne and shame when wisdoms eyes did looke and checke his crime who did foresee and told it him before yet would he needs averre it more and more now went our lord unto that holy place sweet gethsemaine hallowed by his presence that blessed garden which did now embrace his holy corps yet could make no defence against those vipers objects of disgrace which sought that pure eternall love to quench here his disciples willed he to stay whilst he went further where he meant to pray none were admitted with their lord to goe but peter and the sonnes of zebedus to them good jesus opened all his woe he gave them leave his sorows to discusse his deepest griefes he did not scorne to showe these three deere friends so much he did intrust beeing sorowfull and overchargd with griefe he told it them yet lookd for no reliefe sweet lord how couldst thou thus to flesh and blood communicate thy griefe tell of thy woes thou knewst they had no powre to doe thee good but were the cause thou must endure these blowes beeing the scorpions bred in adams mud whose poysned sinnes did worke among thy foes to reorecharge thy overburdned soule although the sorowes now they doe condole yet didst thou tell them of thy troubled state of thy soules heavinesse unto the death so full of love so free wert thou from hate to bid them stay whose sinnes did stop thy breath when thou wert entring at so straite a gate yea entring even into the doore of death thou bidst them tarry there and watch with thee who from thy pretious bloodshed were not free bidding them tarry thou didst further goe to meet affliction in such gracefull sort as might moove pitie both in friend and foe thy sorowes such as none could them comport such great indurements who did ever know when to th almighty thou didst make resort and falling on thy face didst humbly pray if ‘twere his will that cup might passe away saying not my will but thy will lord be done when as thou prayedst an angel did appeare from heaven to comfort thee gods onely sonne that thou thy suffrings mightst the better beare beeing in an agony thy glasse neere run thou prayedst more earnestly in so great feare that pretious sweat came trickling to the ground like drops of blood thy sences to confound loe here his will not thy will lord was done and thou content to undergoe all paines sweet lambe of god his deare beloved sonne by this great purchase what to thee remaines of heaven and earth thou hast a kingdom wonne thy glory beeing equall with thy gaines in ratifying gods promise on the earth made many hundred yeares before thy birth but now returning to thy sleeping friends that could not watch one houre for love of thee even those three friends which on thy grace depends yet shut those eies that should their maker see what colour what excuse or what amends from thy displeasure now can set them free yet thy pure pietie bids them watch and pray lest in temptation they be led away although the spirit was willing to obay yet what great weakenesse in the flesh was found they slept in ease whilst thou in paine didst pray loe they in sleepe and thou in sorow drownd yet gods right hand was unto thee a stay when horror griefe and sorow did abound his angel did appeare from heaven to thee to yeeld thee comfort in extremitie but what could comfort then thy troubled minde when heaven and earth were both against thee bent and thou no hope no ease no rest couldst finde but must restore that life which was but lent was ever creature in the world so kinde but he that from eternitie was sent to satisfie for many worlds of sinne whose matchlesse torments did but then begin if one mans sinne doth challendge death and hell with all the torments that belong thereto if for one sinne such plagues on david fell as grieved him and did his seed undoe if salomon for that he did not well falling from grace did loose his kingdome too ten tribes beeing taken from his wilfull sonne and sinne the cause that they were all undone what could thy innocency now expect when all the sinnes that ever were committed were laid to thee whom no man could detect yet farre thou wert of man from beeing pittied the judge so just could yeeld thee no respect nor would one jot of penance be remitted but greater horror to thy soule must rise than heart can thinke or any wit devise now drawes the houre of thy affliction neere and ugly death presents himselfe before thee thou now must leave those friends thou heldst so deere yea those disciples who did most adore thee yet in thy countenance doth no wrath appeare although betrayd to those that did abhorre thee thou didst vouchsafe to visit them againe who had no apprehension of thy paine their eyes were heavie and their hearts asleepe nor knew they well what answere then to make thee yet thou as watchman hadst a care to keepe those few from sinne that shortly would forsake thee but now thou bidst them henceforth rest and sleepe thy houre is come and they at hand to take thee the sonne of god to sinners made a pray oh hatefull houre oh blest oh cursed day loe here thy great humility was found beeing king of heaven and monarch of the earth yet well content to have thy glory drownd by beeing counted of so meane a berth grace love and mercy did so much abound thou entertaindst the crosse even to the death and namdst thy selfe the sonne of man to be to purge our pride by thy humilitie but now thy friends whom thou didst call to goe heavy spectators of thy haplesse case see thy betrayer whom too well they knowe one of the twelve now object of disgrace a trothlesse traytor and a mortall foe with fained kindnesse seekes thee to imbrace and gives a kisse whereby he may deceive thee that in the hands of sinners he might leave thee now muster forth with swords with staves with bils high priests and scribes and elders of the land seeking by force to have their wicked wils which thou didst never purpose to withstand now thou makst haste unto the worst of ils and who they seeke thou gently doest demand this didst thou lord tamaze these fooles the more tinquire of that thou knewst so well before when loe these monsters did not shame to tell his name they sought and found yet could not know jesus of nazareth at whose feet they fell when heavenly wisdome did descend so lowe to speake to them they knew they did not well their great amazement made them backeward goe nay though he said unto them i am he they could not know him whom their eyes did see how blinde were they could not discerne the light how dull if not to understand the truth how weake if meekenesse overcame their might how stony hearted if not movd to ruth how void of pitie and how full of spight gainst him that was the lord of light and truth here insolent boldnesse checkt by love and grace retires and falls before our makers face for when he spake to this accursed crew and mildely made them know that it was he presents himselfe that they might take a view and what they doubted they might cleerely see nay more to reassure that it was true he said i say unto you i am hee if him they sought hes willing to obay onely desires the rest might goe their way thus with a heart prepared to endure the greatest wrongs impietie could devise he was content to stoope unto their lure although his greatnesse might doe otherwise here grace was seised on with hands impure and virtue now must be supprest by vice pure innocencie made a prey to sinne thus did his torments and our joyes beginne here faire obedience shined in his breast and did suppresse all feare of future paine love was his leader unto this unrest whilst righteousnesse doth carry up his traine mercy made way to make us highly blest when patience beat downe sorrow feare and paine justice sate looking with an angry brow on blessed misery appeering now more glorious than all the conquerors than ever livd within this earthly round more powrefull than all kings or governours that ever yet within this world were found more valiant than the greatest souldiers that ever fought to have their glory crownd for which of them that ever yet tooke breath sought tindure the doome of heaven and earth but our sweet saviour whom these jewes did name yet could their learned ignorance apprehend no light of grace to free themselves from blame zeale lawes religion now they doe pretend against the truth untruths they seeke to frame now al their powres their wits their strengths they bend against one siely weake unarmed man who no resistance makes though much he can to free himselfe from these unlearned men who calld him saviour in his blessed name yet farre from knowing him their saviour then that came to save both them and theirs from blame though they retire and fall they come agen to make a surer purchase of their shame with lights and torches now they find the way to take the shepheard whilst the sheep doe stray why should unlawfull actions use the light inniquitie in darkenesse seekes to dwell sinne rides his circuit in the dead of night teaching all soules the ready waies to hell sathan coms armd with all the powres of spight heartens his champions makes them rude and fell like ravning wolves to shed his guiltlesse blood who thought no harme but did to doe them good here falshood beares the shew of formall right base treacherie hath gote a guard of men tyranny attends with all his strength and might to leade this siely lamb to lyons denne yet he unmoovd in this most wretched plight goes on to meete them knowes the houre and when the powre of darkenesse must expresse gods ire therefore to save these few was his desire these few that wait on poverty and shame and offer to be sharers in his ils these few that will be spreaders of his fame he will not leave to tyrants wicked wils but still desires to free them from all blame yet feare goes forward anger patience kils a saint is mooved to revenge a wrong and mildnesse doth what doth to wrath belong for peter grievd at what might then befall yet knew not what to doe nor what to thinke thought something must be done now if at all to free his master that he might not drinke this poysned draught farre bitterer than gall for now he sees him at the very brinke of griesly death who gins to shew his face clad in all colours of a deepe disgrace and now those hands that never usd to fight or drawe a weapon in his owne defence too forward is to doe his master right since of his wrongs hee feeles so true a sence but ah poore peter now thou wantest might and hees resolvd with them he will goe hence to draw thy sword in such a helpelesse cause offends thy lord and is against the lawes so much he hates revenge so farre from hate that he vouchsafes to heale whom thou dost wound his paths are peace with none he holdes debate his patience stands upon so sure a ground to counsell thee although it comes too late nay to his foes his mercies so abound that he in pitty doth thy will restraine and heales the hurt and takes away the paine for willingly he will endure this wrong although his prayrs might have obtaind such grace as to dissolve their plots though ner so strong and bring these wicked actors in worse case than ægypts king on whom gods plagues did throng but that foregoing scriptures must take place if god by prayers had an army sent of powrefull angels who could them prevent yet mightie jesus meekely askd why they with swords and staves doe come as to a thiefe hee teaching in the temple day by day none did offend or give him cause of griefe now all are forward glad is he that may give most offence and yeeld him least reliefe his hatefull foes are ready now to take him and all his deere disciples do forsake him those deare disciples that he most did love and were attendant at his becke and call when triall of affliction came to prove they first left him who now must leave them all for they were earth and he came from above which made them apt to flie and fit to fall though they protest they never will forsake him they do like men when dangers overtake them and he alone is bound to loose us all whom with unhallowed hands they led along to wicked caiphas in the judgement hall who studies onely how to doe him wrong high priests and elders people great and small with all reprochfull words about him throng false witnesses are now calld in apace whose trothlesse tongues must make pale death imbrace the beauty of the world heavens chiefest glory the mirrour of martyrs crowne of holy saints love of thalmighty blessed angels story water of life which none that drinks it faints guide of the just where all our light we borrow mercy of mercies hearer of complaints triumpher over death ransomer of sinne falsly accused now his paines begin their tongues doe serve him as a passing bell for what they say is certainly beleeved so sound a tale unto the judge they tell that he of life must shortly be bereaved their share of heaven they doe not care to sell so his afflicted heart be throughly grieved they tell his words though farre from his intent and what his speeches were not what he meant that he gods holy temple could destroy and in three daies could build it up againe this seemd to them a vaine and idle toy it would not sinke into their sinful braine christs blessed body al true christians joy should die and in three dayes revive againe this did the lord of heaven and earth endure unjustly to be chargd by tongues impure and now they all doe give attentive eare to heare the answere which he will not make the people wonder how he can forbeare and these great wrongs so patiently can take but yet he answers not nor doth he care much more he will endure for our sake nor can their wisdoms any way discover who he should be that proovd so true a lover to entertaine the sharpest pangs of death and fight a combate in the depth of hell for wretched worldlings made of dust and earth whose hardned hearts with pride and mallice swell in midst of bloody sweat and dying breath he had compassion on these tyrants fell and purchast them a place in heavn for ever when they his soule and body sought to sever sinnes ugly mists so blinded had their eyes that at noone dayes they could discerne no light these were those fooles that thought themselves so wise the jewish wolves that did our saviour bite for now they use all meanes they can devise to beate downe truth and goe against all right yea now they take gods holy name in vaine to know the truth which truth they doe prophane the chiefest helhounds of this hatefull crew rose up to aske what answere he could make against those false accusers in his view that by his speech they might advantage take he held his peace yet knew they said not true no answere would his holy wisdome make till he was charged in his glorious name whose pleasure ‘twas he should endure this shame then with so mild a majestie he spake as they might easly know from whence he came his harmelesse tongue doth no exceptions take nor priests nor people meanes he now to blame but answers folly for true wisdomes sake beeing charged deeply by his powrefull name to tell if christ the sonne of god he be who for our sinnes must die to set us free to thee o caiphas doth he answere give that thou hast said what thou desirst to know and yet thy malice will not let him live so much thou art unto thy selfe a foe he speaketh truth but thou wilt not beleeve nor canst thou apprehend it to be so though he expresse his glory unto thee thy owly eies are blind and cannot see thou rendst thy° cloathes in stead of thy false heart and on the guiltlesse laist thy guilty crime for thou blasphemst and he must feele the smart to sentence death thou thinkst it now high time no witnesse now thou needst for this fowle part thou to the height of wickednesse canst clime and give occasion to the ruder sort to make afflictions sorrows follies sport now when the dawne of day gins to appeare and all your wicked counsels have an end to end his life that holds you all so deere for to that purpose did your studies bend proud pontius pilate must the matter heare to your untroths his eares he now must lend sweet jesus bound to him you led away of his most pretious blood to make your pray which when that wicked caytife did perceive by whose lewd meanes he came to this distresse he brought the price of blood he did receive thinking thereby to make his fault seeme lesse and with these priests and elders did it leave confest his fault wherein he did transgresse but when he saw repentance unrespected he hangd himselfe of god and man rejected by this example what can be expected from wicked man which on the earth doth live but faithlesse dealing feare of god neglected who for their private gaine cares not to sell the innocent blood of gods most deere elected as did that caytife wretch now damnd in hell if in christs schoole he tooke so great a fall what will they doe that come not there at all now pontius pilate is to judge the cause of faultlesse jesus who before him stands who neither hath offended prince nor lawes although he now be brought in woefull bands o noble governour make thou yet a pause doe not in innocent blood imbrue thy hands but heare the words of thy most worthy wife who sends to thee to beg her saviours life let barbrous crueltie farre depart from thee and in true justice take afflictions part open thine eies that thou the truth maist see doe not the thing that goes against thy heart condemne not him that must thy saviour be but view his holy life his good desert let not us women glory in mens fall who had power given to overrule us all till now your indiscretion sets us free eves apologie and makes our former fault much lesse appeare our mother eve who tasted of the tree giving to adam what shee held most deare was simply good and had no powre to see the aftercomming harme did not appeare the subtile serpent that our sex betraide before our fall so sure a plot had laide that undiscerning ignorance perceavd no guile or craft that was by him intended for had she knowne of what we were bereavd to his request she had not condiscended but she poore soule by cunning was deceavd no hurt therein her harmelesse heart intended for she alleadgd gods word which he denies that they should die but even as gods be wise but surely adam can not be excusde her fault though great yet hee was most too blame what weaknesse offerd strength might have refusde being lord of all the greater was his shame although the serpents craft had her abusde gods holy word ought all his actions frame for he was lord and king of all the earth before poore eve had either life or breath who being framd by gods eternall hand the perfectst man that ever breathd on earth and from gods mouth receivd that strait command the breach whereof he knew was present death yea having powre to rule both sea and land yet with one apple wonne to loose that breath which god had breathed in his beauteous face bringing us all in danger and disgrace and then to lay the fault on patience backe that we poore women must endure it all we know right well he did discretion lacke beeing not perswaded thereunto at all if eve did erre it was for knowledge sake the fruit beeing faire perswaded him to fall no subtill serpents falshood did betray him if he would eate it who had powre to stay him not eve whose fault was onely too much love which made her give this present to her deare that what shee tasted he likewise might prove whereby his knowledge might become more cleare he never sought her weakenesse to reprove with those sharpe words which he of god did heare yet men will boast of knowledge which he tooke from eves faire hand as from a learned booke if any evill did in her remaine beeing made of him he was the ground of all if one of many worlds could lay a staine upon our sexe and worke so great a fall to wretched man by satans subtill traine what will so fowle a fault amongst you all her weakenesse did the serpents words obay but you in malice gods deare sonne betray whom if unjustly you condemne to die her sinne was small to what you doe commit all mortall sinnes that doe for vengeance crie are not to be compared unto it if many worlds would altogether trie by all their sinnes the wrath of god to get this sinne of yours surmounts them all as farre as doth the sunne another little starre then let us have our libertie againe and challendge to your selves no sovraigntie you came not in the world without our paine make that a barre against your crueltie your fault beeing greater why should you disdaine our beeing your equals free from tyranny if one weake woman simply did offend this sinne of yours hath no excuse nor end to which poore soules we never gave consent witnesse thy wife o pilate speakes for all who did but dreame and yet a message sent that thou shouldst have nothing to doe at all with that just man which if thy heart relent why wilt thou be a reprobate with saul to seeke the death of him that is so good for thy soules health to shed his dearest blood yea so thou maist these sinful people please thou art content against all truth and right to seale this act that may procure thine ease with blood and wrong with tyrannie and might the multitude thou seekest to appease by base dejection of this heavenly light demanding which of these that thou shouldst loose whether the thiefe or christ king of the jewes base barrabas the thiefe they all desire and thou more base than he performst their will yet when thy thoughts backe to themselves retire thou art unwilling to commit this ill oh that thou couldst unto such grace aspire that thy polluted lips might never kill that honour which right judgement ever graceth to purchase shame which all true worth defaceth art thou a judge and asketh what to do with one in whom no fault there can be found the death of christ wilt thou consent unto finding no cause no reason nor no ground shall he be scourgd and crucified too and must his miseries by thy meanes abound yet not ashamd to aske what he hath done when thine owne conscience seeks this sinne to shunne three times thou askst what evill hath he done and saist thou findst in him no cause of death yet wilt thou chasten gods beloved sonne although to thee no word of ill he saith for wrath must end what malice hath begunne and thou must yield to stop his guiltlesse breath this rude tumultuous rowt doth presse so sore that thou condemnest him thou shouldst adore yet pilate this can yeeld thee no content to exercise thine owne authoritie but unto herod he must needes be sent to reconcile thy selfe by tyrannie was this the greatest good in justice meant when thou perceivst no fault in him to be if thou must make thy peace by virtues fall much better ‘twere not to be friends at all yet neither thy sterne browe nor his great place can draw an answer from the holy one his false accusers nor his great disgrace nor herods scoffes to him they are all one he neither cares nor feares his owne ill case though being despisd and mockt of every one king herods gladnesse gives him little ease neither his anger seekes he to appease yet this is strange that base impietie should yeeld those robes of honour which were due pure white to shew his great integritie his innocency that all the world might view perfections height in lowest penury such glorious poverty as they never knew purple and scarlet well might him beseeme whose pretious blood must all the world redeeme and that imperiall crowne of thornes he wore was much more pretious than the diadem of any king that ever livd before or since his time their honours but a dreame to his eternall glory beeing so poore to make a purchasse of that heavenly realme where god with all his angels lives in peace no griefes nor sorrowes but all joyes increase those royall robes which they in scorne did give to make him odious to the common sort yeeld light of grace to those whose soules shall live within the harbour of this heavenly port much doe they joy and much more doe they grieve his death their life should make his foes such sport with sharpest thornes to pricke his blessed face our joyfull sorrow and his greater grace three feares at once possessed pilates heart the first christs innocencie which so plaine appeares the next that he which now must feele this smart is gods deare sonne for any thing he heares but that which proovd the deepest wounding dart is peoples threatnings which he so much feares that he to cæsar could not be a friend unlesse he sent sweet jesus to his end now pilate thou art proovd a painted wall a golden sepulcher with rotten bones from right to wrong from equitie to fall if none upbraid thee yet the very stones his blood his teares his sighes his bitter groanes all these will witnesse at the latter day when water cannot wash thy sinne away canst thou be innocent that gainst all right wilt yeeld to what thy conscience doth withstand beeing a man of knowledge powre and might to let the wicked carrie such a hand before thy face to blindfold heavns bright light and thou to yeeld to what they did demand washing thy hands thy conscience cannot cleare but to all worlds this staine must needs appeare for loe the guiltie doth accuse the just and faultie judge condemnes the innocent and wilfull jewes to exercise their lust with whips and taunts against their lord are bent he basely usd blasphemed scornd and curst our heavenly king to death for us they sent reproches slanders spittings in his face spight doing all her worst in his disgrace and now this long expected houre drawes neere when blessed saints with angels doe condole his holy march soft pace and heavy cheere in humble sort to yeeld his glorious soule by his deserts the fowlest sinnes to cleare and in theternall booke of heaven to enroule a satisfaction till the generall doome of all sinnes past and all that are to come they that had seene this pitifull procession from pilates palace to mount calvarie might thinke he answerd for some great transgression beeing in such odious sort condemnd to die he plainely shewed that his own profession was virtue patience grace love piety and how by suffering he could conquer more than all the kings that ever livd before first went the crier with open mouth proclayming the heavy sentence of iniquitie the hangman next by his base office clayming his right in hell where sinners never die carrying the nayles the people still blaspheming their maker using all impiety the thieves attending him on either side the serjeants watching while the women crid the teares of the thrice happy women that obtaind such grace daughters from him whose worth the world could not containe immediately to turne about his face as not remembring his great griefe and paine to comfort you whose teares powrd forth apace on floras bankes like shewers of aprils raine your cries inforced mercie grace and love from him whom greatest princes could not moove to speake on word nor once to lift his eyes unto proud pilate no nor herod king by all the questions that they could devise could make him answere to no manner of thing yet these poore women by their pitious cries did moove their lord their lover and their king to take compassion turne about and speake to them whose hearts were ready now to breake most blessed daughters of jerusalem who found such favour in your saviors sight to turne his face when you did pitie him your tearefull eyes beheld his eies more bright your faith and love unto such grace did clime to have reflection from this heavnly light your eagles eyes did gaze against this sunne your hearts did thinke he dead the world were done when spightfull men with torments did oppresse thafflicted body of this innocent dove poore women seeing how much they did transgresse by teares by sighes by cries intreat what may be done among the thickest presse they labour still these tyrants hearts to move in pitie and compassion to forbeare their whipping spurning tearing of his haire but all in vaine their malice hath no end their hearts more hard than flint or marble stone now to his griefe his greatnesse they attend when he god knowes had rather be alone they are his guard yet seeke all meanes to offend well may he grieve well may he sigh and groane under the burthen of a heavy crosse he faintly goes to make their gaine his losse his woefull mother wayting on her sonne all comfortlesse in depth of sorow drowned her griefes extreame although but new begun to see his bleeding body oft shee swouned how could shee choose but thinke her selfe undone he dying with whose glory shee was crowned none ever lost so great a losse as shee beeing sonne and father of eternitie her teares did wash away his pretious blood that sinners might not tread it under feet to worship him and that it did her good upon her knees although in open street knowing he was the jessie floure and bud that must be gathred when it smelld most sweet her sonne

meane mouldes they bee 1235 small griefes seeme great yet use doth make them beare but ah tis hard to stirre a sturdy tree great dangers hardly puts great minds in feare they will conceale their griefes which mightie grow in their stout hearts untill they overflow if then an earthly prince may ill endure the least of those afflictions which he bare how could this allcommaunding king procure such grievous torments with his mind to square legions of angells being at his lure he might have livd in pleasure without care none can conceive the bitter paines he felt when god and man must suffer without guilt take all the suffrings thoughts can thinke upon in evry man that this huge world hath bred let all those paines and suffrings meet in one yet are they not a mite to that he did endure for us oh let us thinke thereon that god should have his pretious blood so shed his greatnesse clothed in our fraile attire and pay so deare a ransome for the hire loe here was glorie miserie life and death an union of contraries did accord gladnesse and sadnesse here had one berth this wonder wrought the passion of our lord he suffring for all the sinnes of all thearth no satisfaction could the

more wealth than in the world remaines thus honourable joseph is possest of what his heart and soule so much desired and now he goes to give that body rest that all his life with griefes and paines was tired he finds a tombe a tombe most rarely blest in which was never creature yet interred there this most pretious body he incloses imbalmd and deckt with lillies and with roses loe here the

where i abide intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee and keep my drooping eyelids open wide looking on darkness which the blind do see save that my souls imaginary sight presents thy shadow to my sightless view which like a jewel hung in ghastly night makes black night beauteous and her old face new lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind for thee and for myself no quiet find how can i then return in happy plight that am debarred the benefit of rest when days oppression is not easd by night but day by night and night by day oppressed and each though enemies to eithers reign do in consent shake hands to torture me the one by toil the other to complain how far i toil still farther off from thee i tell the day to please him thou art bright and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven so flatter i the swartcomplexiond night when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer and night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes i all alone beweep my outcast state and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries and look upon myself and curse my fate wishing me like to one more rich in hope featured like him like him with friends possessed desiring this mans art and that mans scope with what i most enjoy contented least yet in these thoughts my self almost despising haply i think on thee and then my state like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings that then i scorn to change my state with kings when to the sessions of sweet silent thought i summon up remembrance of things past i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought and with old woes new wail my dear times waste then can i drown an eye unused to flow for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night and weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe and moan the expense of many a vanished sight then can i grieve at grievances foregone and heavily from woe to woe tell oer the sad account of forebemoaned moan which i new pay as if not paid before but if the while i think on thee dear friend all losses are restord and sorrows end thy bosom is endeared with all hearts which i by lacking have supposed dead and there reigns love and all loves loving parts and all those friends which i thought buried how many a holy and obsequious tear hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye as interest of the dead which now appear but things removed that hidden in thee lie thou art the grave where buried love doth live hung with the trophies of my lovers gone who all their parts of me to thee did give that due of many now is thine alone their images i loved i view in thee and thou all they hast all the all of me if thou survive my wellcontented day when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover and shalt by fortune once more resurvey these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover compare them with the bettring of the time and though they be outstripped by every pen reserve them for my love not for their rhyme exceeded by the height of happier men o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought had my friends muse grown with this growing age a dearer birth than this his love had brought to march in ranks of better equipage but since he died and poets better prove theirs for their style ill read his for his love full many a glorious morning have i seen flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye kissing with golden face the meadows green gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy anon permit the basest clouds to ride with ugly rack on his celestial face and from the forlorn world his visage hide stealing unseen to west with this disgrace even so my sun one early morn did shine with all triumphant splendour on my brow but out alack he was but one hour mine the region cloud hath maskd him from me now yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth why didst thou promise such a beauteous day and make me travel forth without my cloak to let base clouds oertake me in my way hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke tis not enough that through the cloud thou break to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face for no man well of such a salve can speak that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace nor can thy shame give physic to my grief though thou repent yet i have still the loss the offenders sorrow lends but weak relief to him that bears the strong offences cross ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds no more be grieved atthat which thou hast done roses have thorns and silver fountains mud clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud all men make faults and even i in this authorizing thy trespass with compare myself corrupting salving thy amiss excusing thy sins more than thy sins are for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense thy adverse party is thy advocate and gainst myself a lawful plea commence such civil war is in my love and hate that i an accessary needs must be to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me let me confess that we two must be twain although our undivided loves are one so shall those blots that do with me remain without thy help by me be borne alone in our two loves there is but one respect though in our lives a separable spite which though it alter not loves sole effect yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight i may not evermore acknowledge thee lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame nor thou with public kindness honour me unless thou take that honour from thy name but do not so i love thee in such sort as thou being mine mine is thy good report as a decrepit father takes delight to see his active child do deeds of youth so i made lame by fortunes dearest spite take all my comfort of thy worth and truth for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit or any of these all or all or more entitled in thy parts do crowned sit i make my love engrafted to this store so then i am not lame poor nor despised whilst that this shadow doth such substance give that i in thy abundance am sufficed and by a part of all thy glory live look what is best that best i wish in thee this wish i have then ten times happy me how can my muse want subject to invent while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse thine own sweet argument too excellent for every vulgar paper to rehearse o give thy self the thanks if aught in me worthy perusal stand against thy sight for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee when thou thy self dost give invention light be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth than those old nine which rhymers invocate and he that calls on thee let him bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date if my slight muse do please these curious days the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise o how thy worth with manners may i sing when thou art all the better part of me what can mine own praise to mine own self bring and what ist but mine own when i praise thee even for this let us divided live and our dear love lose name of single one that by this separation i may give that due to thee which thou deservst alone o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave to entertain the time with thoughts of love which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive and that thou teachest how to make one twain by praising him here who doth hence remain take all my loves my love yea take them all what hast thou then more than thou hadst before no love my love that thou mayst true love call all mine was thine before thou hadst this more then if for my love thou my love receivest i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest but yet be blamd if thou thy self deceivest by wilful taste of what thyself refusest i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief although thou steal thee all my poverty and yet love knows it is a greater grief to bear loves wrong than hates known injury lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows kill me with spites yet we must not be foes those pretty wrongs that liberty commits when i am sometime absent from thy heart thy beauty and thy years full well befits for still temptation follows where thou art gentle thou art and therefore to be won beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed and when a woman woos what womans son will sourly leave her till he have prevailed ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth who lead thee in their riot even there where thou art forced to break a twofold truth hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee thine by thy beauty being false to me that thou hast her it is not all my grief and yet it may be said i loved her dearly that she hath thee is of my wailing chief a loss in love that touches me more nearly loving offenders thus i will excuse ye thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her and for my sake even so doth she abuse me suffering my friend for my sake to approve her if i lose thee my loss is my loves gain and losing her my friend hath found that loss both find each other and i lose both twain and both for my sake lay on me this cross but heres the joy my friend and i are one sweet flattery then she loves but me alone when most i wink then do mine eyes best see for all the day they view things unrespected but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee and darkly bright are bright in dark directed then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright how would thy shadows form form happy show to the clear day with thy much clearer light when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so how would i say mine eyes be blessed made by looking on thee in the living day when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay all days are nights to see till i see thee and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me if the dull substance of my flesh were thought injurious distance should not stop my way for then despite of space i would be brought from limits far remote where thou dost stay no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth removed from thee for nimble thought can jump both sea and land as soon as think the place where he would be but ah thought kills me that i am not thought to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone but that so much of earth and water wrought i must attend times leisure with my moan receiving nought by elements so slow but heavy tears badges of eithers woe the other two slight air and purging fire are both with thee wherever i abide the first my thought the other my desire these presentabsent with swift motion slide for when these quicker elements are gone in tender embassy of love to thee my life being made of four with two alone sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy until lifes composition be recured by those swift messengers returnd from thee who even but now come back again assured of thy fair health recounting it to me this told i joy but then no longer glad i send them back again and straight grow sad mine eye and heart are at a mortal war how to divide the conquest of thy sight mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar my heart mine eye the freedom of that right my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie a closet never pierced with crystal eyes but the defendant doth that plea deny and says in him thy fair appearance lies to cide this title is impannelled a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart and by their verdict is determined the clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part as thus mine eyes due is thine outward part and my hearts right thine inward love of heart betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took and each doth good turns now unto the other when that mine eye is famishd for a look or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother with my loves picture then my eye doth feast and to the painted banquet bids my heart another time mine eye is my hearts guest and in his thoughts of love doth share a part so either by thy picture or my love thy self away art present still with me for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move and i am still with them and they with thee or if they sleep thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight how careful was i when i took my way each trifle under truest bars to thrust that to my use it might unused stay from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust but thou to whom my jewels trifles are most worthy comfort now my greatest grief thou best of dearest and mine only care art left the prey of every vulgar thief thee have i not locked up in any chest save where thou art not though i feel thou art within the gentle closure of my breast from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear against that time if ever that time come when i shall see thee frown on my defects when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum called to that audit by advisd respects against that time when thou shalt strangely pass and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye when love converted from the thing it was shall reasons find of settled gravity against that time do i ensconce me here within the knowledge of mine own desert and this my hand against my self uprear to guard the lawful reasons on thy part to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws since why to love i can allege no cause how heavy do i journey on the way when what i seek my weary travels end doth teach that ease and that repose to say thus far the miles are measured from thy friend the beast that bears me tired with my woe plods dully on to bear that weight in me as if by some instinct the wretch did know his rider lovd not speed being made from thee the bloody spur cannot provoke him on that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide which heavily he answers with a groan more sharp to me than spurring to his side for that same groan doth put this in my mind my grief lies onward and my joy behind thus can my love excuse the slow offence of my dull bearer when from thee i speed from where thou art why should i haste me thence till i return of posting is no need o what excuse will my poor beast then find when swift extremity can seem but slow then should i spur though mounted on the wind in winged speed no motion shall i know then can no horse with my desire keep pace therefore desire of perfectst love being made shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race but love for love thus shall excuse my jade since from thee going he went wilfulslow towards thee ill run and give him leave to go so am i as the rich whose blessed key can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure the which he will not every hour survey for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare since seldom coming in the long year set like stones of worth they thinly placed are or captain jewels in the carcanet so is the time that keeps you as my chest or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide to make some special instant specialblest by new unfolding his imprisoned pride blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope being had to triumph being lacked to hope what is your substance whereof are you made that millions of strange shadows on you tend since every one hath every one one shade and you but one can every shadow lend describe adonis and the counterfeit is poorly imitated after you on helens cheek all art of beauty set and you in grecian tires are painted new speak of the spring and foison of the year the one doth shadow of your beauty show the other as your bounty doth appear and you in every blessed shape we know in all external grace you have some part but you like none none you for constant heart o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem by that sweet ornament which truth doth give the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem for that sweet odour which doth in it live the canker blooms have full as deep a dye as the perfumed tincture of the roses hang on such thorns and play as wantonly when summers breath their masked buds discloses but for their virtue only is their show they live unwood and unrespected fade die to themselves sweet roses do not so of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made and so of you beauteous and lovely youth when that shall vade my verse distills your truth not marble nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone besmeard with sluttish time when wasteful war shall statues overturn and broils root out the work of masonry nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn the living record of your memory gainst death and all oblivious enmity shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom so till the judgment that yourself arise you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes sweet love renew thy force be it not said thy edge should blunter be than appetite which but today by feeding is allayed tomorrow sharpened in his former might so love be thou although today thou fill thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness tomorrow see again and do not kill the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness let this sad interim like the ocean be which parts the shore where two contracted new come daily to the banks that when they see return of love more blest may be the view as call it winter which being full of care makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare being your slave what should i do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire i have no precious time at all to spend nor services to do till you require nor dare i chide the world without end hour whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you nor think the bitterness of absence sour when you have bid your servant once adieu nor dare i question with my jealous thought where you may be or your affairs suppose but like a sad slave stay and think of nought save where you are how happy you make those so true a fool is love that in your will though you do anything he thinks no ill that god forbid that made me first your slave i should in thought control your times of pleasure or at your hand the account of hours to crave being your vassal bound to stay your leisure o let me suffer being at your beck the imprisond absence of your liberty and patience tame to sufferance bide each check without accusing you of injury be where you list your charter is so strong that you yourself may privilege your time to what you will to you it doth belong yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime i am to wait though waiting so be hell not blame your pleasure be it ill or well if there be nothing new but that which is hath been before how are our brains beguild which labouring for invention bear amiss the second burthen of a former child oh that record could with a backward look even of five hundred courses of the sun show me your image in some antique book since mind at first in character was done that i might see what the old world could say to this composed wonder of your frame whether we are mended or where better they or whether revolution be the same oh sure i am the wits of former days to subjects worse have given admiring praise like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore so do our minutes hasten to their end each changing place with that which goes before in sequent toil all forwards do contend nativity once in the main of light crawls to maturity wherewith being crownd crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight and time that gave doth now his gift confound time doth transfix the flourish set on youth and delves the parallels in beautys brow feeds on the rarities of natures truth and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand praising thy worth despite his cruel hand is it thy will thy image should keep open my heavy eyelids to the weary night dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken while shadows like to thee do mock my sight is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee so far from home into my deeds to pry to find out shames and idle hours in me the scope and tenor of thy jealousy o no thy love though much is not so great it is my love that keeps mine eye awake mine own true love that doth my rest defeat to play the watchman ever for thy sake for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere from me far off with others all too near sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye and all my soul and all my every part and for this sin there is no remedy it is so grounded inward in my heart methinks no face so gracious is as mine no shape so true no truth of such account and for myself mine own worth do define as i all other in all worths surmount but when my glass shows me myself indeed beated and choppd with tanned antiquity mine own selflove quite contrary i read self so selfloving were iniquity tis thee myself that for myself i praise painting my age with beauty of thy days against my love shall be as i am now with times injurious hand crushed and oerworn when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn hath travelled on to ages steepy night and all those beauties whereof now hes king are vanishing or vanished out of sight stealing away the treasure of his spring for such a time do i now fortify against confounding ages cruel knife that he shall never cut from memory my sweet loves beauty though my lovers life his beauty shall in these black lines be seen and they shall live and he in them still green when i have seen by times fell hand defaced the rich proud cost of outworn buried age when sometime lofty towers i see downrazed and brass eternal slave to mortal rage when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore and the firm soil win of the watery main increasing store with loss and loss with store when i have seen such interchange of state or state itself confounded to decay ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate that time will come and take my love away this thought is as a death which cannot choose but weep to have that which it fears to lose since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea but sad mortality oersways their power how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea whose action is no stronger than a flower o how shall summers honey breath hold out against the wrackful siege of battering days when rocks impregnable are not so stout nor gates of steel so strong but time decays o fearful meditation where alack shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back or who his spoil of beauty can forbid o none unless this miracle have might that in black ink my love may still shine bright tired with all these for restful death i cry as to behold desert a beggar born and needy nothing trimmd in jollity and purest faith unhappily forsworn and gilded honour shamefully misplaced and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted and right perfection wrongfully disgraced and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tonguetied by authority and folly doctorlike controlling skill and simple truth miscalled simplicity and captive good attending captain ill tired with all these from these would i be gone save that to die i leave my love alone ah wherefore with infection should he live and with his presence grace impiety that sin by him advantage should achieve and lace itself with his society why should false painting imitate his cheek and steal dead seeming of his living hue why should poor beauty indirectly seek roses of shadow since his rose is true why should he live now nature bankrupt is beggared of blood to blush through lively veins for she hath no exchequer now but his and proud of many lives upon his gains o him she stores to show what wealth she had in days long since before these last so bad thus is his cheek the map of days outworn when beauty lived and died as flowers do now before these bastard signs of fair were born or durst inhabit on a living brow before the golden tresses of the dead the right of sepulchres were shorn away to live a second life on second head ere beautys dead fleece made another gay in him those holy antique hours are seen without all ornament itself and true making no summer of anothers green robbing no old to dress his beauty new and him as for a map doth nature store to show false art what beauty was of yore those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due uttering bare truth even so as foes commend thy outward thus with outward praise is crownd but those same tongues that give thee so thine own in other accents do this praise confound by seeing farther than the eye hath shown they look into the beauty of thy mind and that in guess they measure by thy deeds then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds but why thy odour matcheth not thy show the soil is this that thou dost common grow that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect for slanders mark was ever yet the fair the ornament of beauty is suspect a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air so thou be good slander doth but approve thy worth the greater being wooed of time for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love and thou presentst a pure unstained prime thou hast passed by the ambush of young days either not assailed or victor being charged yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise to tie up envy evermore enlarged if some suspect of ill masked not thy show then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell nay if you read this line remember not the hand that writ it for i love you so that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot if thinking on me then should make you woe o if i say you look upon this verse when i perhaps compounded am with clay do not so much as my poor name rehearse but let your love even with my life decay lest the wise world should look into your moan and mock you with me after i am gone o lest the world should task you to recite what merit lived in me that you should love after my deathdear love forget me quite for you in me can nothing worthy prove unless you would devise some virtuous lie to do more for me than mine own desert and hang more praise upon deceased i than niggard truth would willingly impart o lest your true love may seem false in this that you for love speak well of me untrue my name be buried where my body is and live no more to shame nor me nor you for i am shamed by that which i bring forth and so should you to love things nothing worth that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves or none or few do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang in me thou seest the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west which by and by black night doth take away deaths second self that seals up all in rest in me thou seest the glowing of such fire that on the ashes of his youth doth lie as the deathbed whereon it must expire consumed with that which it was nourishd by this thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong to love that well which thou must leave ere long but be contented when that fell arrest without all bail shall carry me away my life hath in this line some interest which for memorial still with thee shall stay when thou reviewest this thou dost review the very part was consecrate to thee the earth can have but earth which is his due my spirit is thine the better part of me so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life the prey of worms my body being dead the coward conquest of a wretchs knife too base of thee to be remembered the worth of that is that which it contains and that is this and this with thee remains so are you to my thoughts as food to life or as sweetseasond showers are to the ground and for the peace of you i hold such strife as twixt a miser and his wealth is found now proud as an enjoyer and anon doubting the filching age will steal his treasure now counting best to be with you alone then betterd that the world may see my pleasure sometime all full with feasting on your sight and by and by clean starved for a look possessing or pursuing no delight save what is had or must from you be took thus do i pine and surfeit day by day or gluttoning on all or all away why is my verse so barren of new pride so far from variation or quick change why with the time do i not glance aside to newfound methods and to compounds strange why write i still all one ever the same and keep invention in a noted weed that every word doth almost tell my name showing their birth and where they did proceed o know sweet love i always write of you and you and love are still my argument so all my best is dressing old words new spending again what is already spent for as the sun is daily new and old so is my love still telling what is told thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear thy dial how thy precious minutes waste the vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear and of this book this learning mayst thou taste the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show of mouthed graves will give thee memory thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know times thievish progress to eternity look what thy memory cannot contain commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find those children nursed delivered from thy brain to take a new acquaintance of thy mind these offices so oft as thou wilt look shall profit thee and much enrich thy book so oft have i invoked thee for my muse and found such fair assistance in my verse as every alien pen hath got my use and under thee their poesy disperse thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing and heavy ignorance aloft to fly have added feathers to the learneds wing and given grace a double majesty yet be most proud of that which i compile whose influence is thine and born of thee in others works thou dost but mend the style and arts with thy sweet graces graced be but thou art all my art and dost advance as high as learning my rude ignorance whilst i alone did call upon thy aid my verse alone had all thy gentle grace but now my gracious numbers are decayed and my sick muse doth give an other place i grant sweet love thy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen yet what of thee thy poet doth invent he robs thee of and pays it thee again he lends thee virtue and he stole that word from thy behaviour beauty doth he give and found it in thy cheek he can afford no praise to thee but what in thee doth live then thank him not for that which he doth say since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay o how i faint when i of you do write knowing a better spirit doth use your name and in the praise thereof spends all his might to make me tonguetied speaking of your fame but since your worth wide as the ocean is the humble as the proudest sail doth bear my saucy bark inferior far to his on your broad main doth wilfully appear your shallowest help will hold me up afloat whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride or being wracked i am a worthless boat he of tall building and of goodly pride then if he thrive and i be cast away the worst was this my love was my decay or i shall live your epitaph to make or you survive when i in earth am rotten from hence your memory death cannot take although in me each part will be forgotten your name from hence immortal life shall have though i once gone to all the world must die the earth can yield me but a common grave when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie your monument shall be my gentle verse which eyes not yet created shall oerread and tongues to be your being shall rehearse when all the breathers of this world are dead you still shall live such virtue hath my pen where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men i grant thou wert not married to my muse and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook the dedicated words which writers use of their fair subject blessing every book thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue finding thy worth a limit past my praise and therefore art enforced to seek anew some fresher stamp of the timebettering days and do so love yet when they have devised what strained touches rhetoric can lend thou truly fair wert truly sympathized in true plain words by thy truetelling friend and their gross painting might be better used where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused i never saw that you did painting need and therefore to your fair no painting set i found or thought i found you did exceed the barren tender of a poets debt and therefore have i slept in your report that you yourself being extant well might show how far a modern quill doth come too short speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow this silence for my sin you did impute which shall be most my glory being dumb for i impair not beauty being mute when others would give life and bring a tomb there lives more life in one of your fair eyes than both your poets can in praise devise who is it that says most which can say more than this rich praise that you alone are you in whose confine immured is the store which should example where your equal grew lean penury within that pen doth dwell that to his subject lends not some small glory but he that writes of you if he can tell that you are you so dignifies his story let him but copy what in you is writ not making worse what nature made so clear and such a counterpart shall fame his wit making his style admired every where you to your beauteous blessings add a curse being fond on praise which makes your praises worse my tonguetied muse in manners holds her still while comments of your praise richly compiled reserve thy character with golden quill and precious phrase by all the muses filed i think good thoughts whilst others write good words and like unlettered clerk still cry amen to every hymn that able spirit affords in polished form of wellrefined pen hearing you praised i say tis so tis true and to the most of praise add something more but that is in my thought whose love to you though words come hindmost holds his rank before then others for the breath of words respect me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect was it the proud full sail of his great verse bound for the prize of all too precious you that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse making their tomb the womb wherein they grew was it his spirit by spirits taught to write above a mortal pitch that struck me dead no neither he nor his compeers by night giving him aid my verse astonished he nor that affable familiar ghost which nightly gulls him with intelligence as victors of my silence cannot boast i was not sick of any fear from thence but when your countenance filled up his line then lacked i matter that enfeebled mine farewell thou art too dear for my possessing and like enough thou knowst thy estimate the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing my bonds in thee are all determinate for how do i hold thee but by thy granting and for that riches where is my deserving the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting and so my patent back again is swerving thy self thou gavest thy own worth then not knowing or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking so thy great gift upon misprision growing comes home again on better judgement making thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter in sleep a king but waking no such matter when thou shalt be disposed to set me light and place my merit in the eye of scorn upon thy side against myself ill fight and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn with mine own weakness being best acquainted upon thy part i can set down a story of faults concealed wherein i am attainted that thou in losing me shalt win much glory and i by this will be a gainer too for bending all my loving thoughts on thee the injuries that to myself i do doing thee vantage doublevantage me such is my love to thee i so belong that for thy right myself will bear all wrong say that thou didst forsake me for some fault and i will comment upon that offence speak of my lameness and i straight will halt against thy reasons making no defence thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill to set a form upon desired change as ill myself disgrace knowing thy will i will acquaintance strangle and look strange be absent from thy walks and in my tongue thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell lest i too much profane should do it wrong and haply of our old acquaintance tell for thee against my self ill vow debate for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate then hate me when thou wilt if ever now now while the world is bent my deeds to cross join with the spite of fortune make me bow and do not drop in for an afterloss ah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrow come in the rearward of a conquered woe give not a windy night a rainy morrow to linger out a purposed overthrow if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last when other petty griefs have done their spite but in the onset come so shall i taste at first the very worst of fortunes might and other strains of woe which now seem woe compared with loss of thee will not seem so some glory in their birth some in their skill some in their wealth some in their bodys force some in their garments though newfangled ill some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure wherein it finds a joy above the rest but these particulars are not my measure all these i better in one general best thy love is better than high birth to me richer than wealth prouder than garments cost of more delight than hawks and horses be and having thee of all mens pride i boast wretched in this alone that thou mayst take all this away and me most wretched make but do thy worst to steal thyself away for term of life thou art assured mine and life no longer than thy love will stay for it depends upon that love of thine then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs when in the least of them my life hath end i see a better state to me belongs than that which on thy humour doth depend thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind since that my life on thy revolt doth lie o what a happy title do i find happy to have thy love happy to die but whats so blessedfair that fears no blot thou mayst be false and yet i know it not so shall i live supposing thou art true like a deceived husband so loves face may still seem love to me though altered new thy looks with me thy heart in other place for there can live no hatred in thine eye therefore in that i cannot know thy change in manys looks the false hearts history is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange but heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show they that have power to hurt and will do none that do not do the thing they most do show who moving others are themselves as stone unmoved cold and to temptation slow they rightly do inherit heavens graces and husband natures riches from expense they are the lords and owners of their faces others but stewards of their excellence the summers flower is to the summer sweet though to itself it only live and die but if that flower with base infection meet the basest weed outbraves his dignity for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame which like a canker in the fragrant rose doth spot the beauty of thy budding name o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose that tongue that tells the story of thy days making lascivious comments on thy sport cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise naming thy name blesses an ill report o what a mansion have those vices got which for their habitation chose out thee where beautys veil doth cover every blot and all things turns to fair that eyes can see take heed dear heart of this large privilege the hardest knife illused doth lose his edge some say thy fault is youth some wantonness some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport both grace and faults are lovd of more and less thou makst faults graces that to thee resort as on the finger of a throned queen the basest jewel will be well esteemd so are those errors that in thee are seen to truths translated and for true things deemd how many lambs might the stern wolf betray if like a lamb he could his looks translate how many gazers mightst thou lead away if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state but do not so i love thee in such sort as thou being mine mine is thy good report how like a winter hath my absence been from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year what freezings have i felt what dark days seen what old decembers bareness everywhere and yet this time removed was summers time the teeming autumn big with rich increase bearing the wanton burden of the prime like widowd wombs after their lords decease yet this abundant issue seemed to me but hope of orphans and unfathered fruit for summer and his pleasures wait on thee and thou away the very birds are mute or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer that leaves look pale dreading the winters near from you have i been absent in the spring when proud pied april dressed in all his trim hath put a spirit of youth in every thing that heavy saturn laughed and leapt with him yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue could make me any summers story tell or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew nor did i wonder at the lilys white nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose they were but sweet but figures of delight drawn after you you pattern of all those yet seemed it winter still and you away as with your shadow i with these did play the forward violet thus did i chide sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells if not from my loves breath the purple pride which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells in my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyd the lily i condemned for thy hand and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair the roses fearfully on thorns did stand one blushing shame another white despair a third nor red nor white had stoln of both and to his robbery had annexed thy breath but for his theft in pride of all his growth a vengeful canker eat him up to death more flowers i noted yet i none could see but sweet or colour it had stoln from thee where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long to speak of that which gives thee all thy might spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song darkening thy power to lend base subjects light return forgetful muse and straight redeem in gentle numbers time so idly spent sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem and gives thy pen both skill and argument rise resty muse my loves sweet face survey if time have any wrinkle graven there if any be a satire to decay and make times spoils despised every where give my love fame faster than time wastes life so thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife o truant muse what shall be thy amends for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed both truth and beauty on my love depends so dost thou too and therein dignified make answer muse wilt thou not haply say truth needs no colour with his colour fixed beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay but best is best if never intermixed because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb excuse not silence so fort lies in thee to make him much outlive a gilded tomb and to be praised of ages yet to be then do thy office muse i teach thee how to make him seem long hence as he shows now my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming i love not less though less the show appear that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming the owners tongue doth publish every where our love was new and then but in the spring when i was wont to greet it with my lays as philomel in summers front doth sing and stops his pipe in growth of riper days not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night but that wild music burthens every bough and sweets grown common lose their dear delight therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue because i would not dull you with my song alack what poverty my muse brings forth that having such a scope to show her pride the argument all bare is of more worth than when it hath my added praise beside o blame me not if i no more can write look in your glass and there appears a face that overgoes my blunt invention quite dulling my lines and doing me disgrace were it not sinful then striving to mend to mar the subject that before was well for to no other pass my verses tend than of your graces and your gifts to tell and more much more than in my verse can sit your own glass shows you when you look in it to me fair friend you never can be old for as you were when first your eye i eyd such seems your beauty still three winters cold have from the forests shook three summers pride three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned in process of the seasons have i seen three april perfumes in three hot junes burned since first i saw you fresh which yet are green ah yet doth beauty like a dialhand steal from his figure and no pace perceived so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand hath motion and mine eye may be deceived for fear of which hear this thou age unbred ere you were born was beautys summer dead let not my love be called idolatry nor my beloved as an idol show since all alike my songs and praises be to one of one still such and ever so kind is my love today tomorrow kind still constant in a wondrous excellence therefore my verse to constancy confined one thing expressing leaves out difference fair kind and true is all my argument fair kind and true varying to other words and in this change is my invention spent three themes in one which wondrous scope affords fair kind and true have often lived alone which three till now never kept seat in one when in the chronicle of wasted time i see descriptions of the fairest wights and beauty making beautiful old rhyme in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights then in the blazon of sweet beautys best of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow i see their antique pen would have expressed even such a beauty as you master now so all their praises are but prophecies of this our time all you prefiguring and for they looked but with divining eyes they had not skill enough your worth to sing for we which now behold these present days have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul of the wide world dreaming on things to come can yet the lease of my true love control supposed as forfeit to a confined doom the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured and the sad augurs mock their own presage incertainties now crown themselves assured and peace proclaims olives of endless age now with the drops of this most balmy time my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes since spite of him ill live in this poor rhyme while he insults oer dull and speechless tribes and thou in this shalt find thy monument when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent whats in the brain that ink may character which hath not figured to thee my true spirit whats new to speak what now to register that may express my love or thy dear merit nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine i must each day say oer the very same counting no old thing old thou mine i thine even as when first i hallowed thy fair name so that eternal love in loves fresh case weighs not the dust and injury of age nor gives to necessary wrinkles place but makes antiquity for aye his page finding the first conceit of love there bred where time and outward form would show it dead o never say that i was false of heart though absence seemed my flame to qualify as easy might i from my self depart as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie that is my home of love if i have ranged like him that travels i return again just to the time not with the time exchanged so that myself bring water for my stain never believe though in my nature reigned all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood that it could so preposterously be stained to leave for nothing all thy sum of good for nothing this wide universe i call save thou my rose in it thou art my all alas tis true i have gone here and there and made my self a motley to the view gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear made old offences of affections new most true it is that i have looked on truth askance and strangely but by all above these blenches gave my heart another youth and worse essays proved thee my best of love now all is done have what shall have no end mine appetite i never more will grind on newer proof to try an older friend a god in love to whom i am confined then give me welcome next my heaven the best even to thy pure and most most loving breast o for my sake do you with fortune chide the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds that did not better for my life provide than public means which public manners breeds thence comes it that my name receives a brand and almost thence my nature is subdued to what it works in like the dyers hand pity me then and wish i were renewed whilst like a willing patient i will drink potions of eisel gainst my strong infection no bitterness that i will bitter think nor double penance to correct correction pity me then dear friend and i assure ye even that your pity is enough to cure me your love and pity doth the impression fill which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow for what care i who calls me well or ill so you oergreen my bad my good allow you are my alltheworld and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue none else to me nor i to none alive that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong in so profound abysm i throw all care of others voices that my adders sense to critic and to flatterer stopped are mark how with my neglect i do dispense you are so strongly in my purpose bred that all the world besides methinks yare dead since i left you mine eye is in my mind and that which governs me to go about doth part his function and is partly blind seems seeing but effectually is out for it no form delivers to the heart of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch of his quick objects hath the mind no part nor his own vision holds what it doth catch for if it see the rudst or gentlest sight the most sweet favour or deformedst creature the mountain or the sea the day or night the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature incapable of more replete with you my most true mind thus maketh mine eye untrue or whether doth my mind being crowned with you drink up the monarchs plague this flattery or whether shall i say mine eye saith true and that your love taught it this alchemy to make of monsters and things indigest such cherubins as your sweet self resemble creating every bad a perfect best as fast as objects to his beams assemble o tis the first tis flattery in my seeing and my great mind most kingly drinks it up mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing and to his palate doth prepare the cup if it be poisoned tis the lesser sin that mine eye loves it and doth first begin those lines that i before have writ do lie even those that said i could not love you dearer yet then my judgment knew no reason why my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer but reckoning time whose milliond accidents creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents divert strong minds to the course of altering things alas why fearing of times tyranny might i not then say now i love you best when i was certain oer incertainty crowning the present doubting of the rest love is a babe then might i not say so to give full growth to that which still doth grow let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove o no it is an everfixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken it is the star to every wandering bark whose worths unknown although his height be taken loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickles compass come love alters not with his brief hours and weeks but bears it out even to the edge of doom if this be error and upon me proved i never writ nor no man ever loved accuse me thus that i have scanted all wherein i should your great deserts repay forgot upon your dearest love to call whereto all bonds do tie me day by day that i have frequent been with unknown minds and given to time your own dearpurchased right that i have hoisted sail to all the winds which should transport me farthest from your sight book both my wilfulness and errors down and on just proof surmise accumulate bring me within the level of your frown but shoot not at me in your wakened hate since my appeal says i did strive to prove the constancy and virtue of your love like as to make our appetites more keen with eager compounds we our palate urge as to prevent our maladies unseen we sicken to shun sickness when we purge even so being full of your neercloying sweetness to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness to be diseased ere that there was true needing thus policy in love to anticipate the ills that were not grew to faults assured and brought to medicine a healthful state which rank of goodness would by ill be cured but thence i learn and find the lesson true drugs poison him that so fell sick of you what potions have i drunk of siren tears distilled from limbecks foul as hell within applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears still losing when i saw myself to win what wretched errors hath my heart committed whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted in the distraction of this madding fever o benefit of ill now i find true that better is by evil still made better and ruined love when it is built anew grows fairer than at first more strong far greater so i return rebuked to my content and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent that you were once unkind befriends me now and for that sorrow which i then did feel needs must i under my transgression bow unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel for if you were by my unkindness shaken as i by yours youve passed a hell of time and i a tyrant have no leisure taken to weigh how once i suffered in your crime o that our night of woe might have remembered my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits and soon to you as you to me then tendered the humble salve which wounded bosoms fits but that your trespass now becomes a fee mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me tis better to be vile than vile esteemed when not to be receives reproach of being and the just pleasure lost which is so deemed not by our feeling but by others seeing for why should others false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood or on my frailties why are frailer spies which in their wills count bad what i think good no i am that i am and they that level at my abuses reckon up their own i may be straight though they themselves be bevel by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown unless this general evil they maintain all men are bad and in their badness reign thy gift thy tables are within my brain full charactered with lasting memory which shall above that idle rank remain beyond all date even to eternity or at the least so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist till each to razed oblivion yield his part of thee thy record never can be missed that poor retention could not so much hold nor need i tallies thy dear love to score therefore to give them from me was i bold to trust those tables that receive thee more to keep an adjunct to remember thee were to import forgetfulness in me no time thou shalt not boast that i do change thy pyramids built up with newer might to me are nothing novel nothing strange they are but dressings of a former sight our dates are brief and therefore we admire what thou dost foist upon us that is old and rather make them born to our desire than think that we before have heard them told thy registers and thee i both defy not wondering at the present nor the past for thy records and what we see doth lie made more or less by thy continual haste this i do vow and this shall ever be i will be true despite thy scythe and thee if my dear love were but the child of state it might for fortunes bastard be unfathered as subject to times love or to times hate weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered no it was builded far from accident it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls under the blow of thralled discontent whereto th inviting time our fashion calls it fears not policy that heretic which works on leases of shortnumberd hours but all alone stands hugely politic that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers to this i witness call the fools of time which die for goodness who have lived for crime weret aught to me i bore the canopy with my extern the outward honouring or laid great bases for eternity which proves more short than waste or ruining have i not seen dwellers on form and favour lose all and more by paying too much rent for compound sweet forgoing simple savour pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent no let me be obsequious in thy heart and take thou my oblation poor but free which is not mixed with seconds knows no art but mutual render only me for thee hence thou suborned informer a true soul when most impeached stands least in thy control o thou my lovely boy who in thy power dost hold times fickle glass his sickle hour who hast by waning grown and therein showest thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growest if nature sovereign mistress over wrack as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure she may detain but not still keep her treasure her audit though delayed answered must be and her quietus is to render thee     in the old age black was not counted fair or if it were it bore not beautys name but now is black beautys successive heir and beauty slandered with a bastard shame for since each hand hath put on natures power fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower but is profaned if not lives in disgrace therefore my mistress eyes are raven black her eyes so suited and they mourners seem at such who not born fair no beauty lack slandring creation with a false esteem yet so they mourn becoming of their woe that every tongue says beauty should look so how oft when thou my music music playst upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds with thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst the wiry concord that mine ear confounds do i envy those jacks that nimble leap to kiss the tender inward of thy hand whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap at the woods boldness by thee blushing stand to be so tickled they would change their state and situation with those dancing chips oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait making dead wood more blessd than living lips since saucy jacks so happy are in this give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss the expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action and till action lust is perjured murderous bloody full of blame savage extreme rude cruel not to trust enjoyed no sooner but despised straight past reason hunted and no sooner had past reason hated as a swallowed bait on purpose laid to make the taker mad mad in pursuit and in possession so had having and in quest to have extreme a bliss in proof and proved a very woe before a joy proposed behind a dream all this the world well knows yet none knows well to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun coral is far more red than her lips red if snow be white why then her breasts are dun if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head i have seen roses damasked red and white but no such roses see i in her cheeks and in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks i love to hear her speak yet well i know that music hath a far more pleasing sound i grant i never saw a goddess go my mistress when she walks treads on the ground and yet by heaven i think my love as rare as any she belied with false compare thou art as tyrannous so as thou art as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel for well thou knowst to my dear doting heart thou art the fairest and most precious jewel yet in good faith some say that thee behold thy face hath not the power to make love groan to say they err i dare not be so bold although i swear it to myself alone and to be sure that is not false i swear a thousand groans but thinking on thy face one on anothers neck do witness bear thy black is fairest in my judgments place in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds and thence this slander as i think proceeds thine eyes i love and they as pitying me knowing thy heart torments me with disdain have put on black and loving mourners be looking with pretty ruth upon my pain and truly not the morning sun of heaven better becomes the grey cheeks of the east nor that full star that ushers in the even doth half that glory to the sober west as those two mourning eyes become thy face o let it then as well beseem thy heart to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace and suit thy pity like in every part then will i swear beauty herself is black and all they foul that thy complexion lack beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan for that deep wound it gives my friend and me ist not enough to torture me alone but slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken and my next self thou harder hast engrossed of him myself and thee i am forsaken a torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward but then my friends heart let my poor heart bail whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard thou canst not then use rigour in my jail and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee perforce am thine and all that is in me so now i have confessed that he is thine and i my self am mortgaged to thy will myself ill forfeit so that other mine thou wilt restore to be my comfort still but thou wilt not nor he will not be free for thou art covetous and he is kind he learned but suretylike to write for me under that bond that him as fast doth bind the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take thou usurer that putst forth all to use and sue a friend came debtor for my sake so him i lose through my unkind abuse him have i lost thou hast both him and me he pays the whole and yet am i not free whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will and will to boot and will in overplus more than enough am i that vexed thee still to thy sweet will making addition thus wilt thou whose will is large and spacious not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine shall will in others seem right gracious and in my will no fair acceptance shine the sea all water yet receives rain still and in abundance addeth to his store so thou being rich in will add to thy will one will of mine to make thy large will more let no unkind no fair beseechers kill think all but one and me in that one will if thy soul check thee that i come so near swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will and will thy soul knows is admitted there thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil will will fulfil the treasure of thy love ay fill it full with wills and my will one in things of great receipt with ease we prove among a number one is reckoned none then in the number let me pass untold though in thy stores account i one must be for nothing hold me so it please thee hold that nothing me a something sweet to thee make but my name thy love and love that still and then thou lovest me for my name is will thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes that they behold and see not what they see they know what beauty is see where it lies yet what the best is take the worst to be if eyes corrupt by overpartial looks be anchored in the bay where all men ride why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks whereto the judgment of my heart is tied why should my heart think that a several plot which my heart knows the wide worlds common place or mine eyes seeing this say this is not to put fair truth upon so foul a face in things right true my heart and eyes have erred and to this false plague are they now transferred when my love swears that she is made of truth i do believe her though i know she lies that she might think me some untutored youth unlearned in the worlds false subtleties thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young although she knows my days are past the best simply i credit her falsespeaking tongue on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed but wherefore says she not she is unjust and wherefore say not i that i am old o loves best habit is in seeming trust and age in love loves not to have years told therefore i lie with her and she with me and in our faults by lies we flattered be o call not me to justify the wrong that thy unkindness lays upon my heart wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue use power with power and slay me not by art tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside what needst thou wound with cunning when thy might is more than my oerpressed defence can bide let me excuse thee ah my love well knows her pretty looks have been mine enemies and therefore from my face she turns my foes that they elsewhere might dart their injuries yet do not so but since i am near slain kill me outright with looks and rid my pain be wise as thou art cruel do not press my tonguetied patience with too much disdain lest sorrow lend me words and words express the manner of my pitywanting pain if i might teach thee wit better it were though not to love yet love to tell me so as testy sick men when their deaths be near no news but health from their physicians know for if i should despair i should grow mad and in my madness might speak ill of thee now this illwresting world is grown so bad mad slanderers by mad ears believed be that i may not be so nor thou belied bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes for they in thee a thousand errors note but tis my heart that loves what they despise who in despite of view is pleased to dote nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted nor tender feeling to base touches prone nor taste nor smell desire to be invited to any sensual feast with thee alone but my five wits nor my five senses can dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be only my plague thus far i count my gain that she that makes me sin awards me pain love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving o but with mine compare thou thine own state and thou shalt find it merits not reproving or if it do not from those lips of thine that have profaned their scarlet ornaments and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine robbed others beds revenues of their rents be it lawful i love thee as thou lovst those whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee root pity in thy heart that when it grows thy pity may deserve to pitied be if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide by selfexample mayst thou be denied lo as a careful housewife runs to catch one of her feathered creatures broke away sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch in pursuit of the thing she would have stay whilst her neglected child holds her in chase cries to catch her whose busy care is bent to follow that which flies before her face not prizing her poor infants discontent so runnst thou after that which flies from thee whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me and play the mothers part kiss me be kind so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will if thou turn back and my loud crying still two loves i have of comfort and despair which like two spirits do suggest me still the better angel is a man right fair the worser spirit a woman coloured ill to win me soon to hell my female evil tempteth my better angel from my side and would corrupt my saint to be a devil wooing his purity with her foul pride and whether that my angel be turned fiend suspect i may yet not directly tell but being both from me both to each friend i guess one angel in anothers hell yet this shall i neer know but live in doubt till my bad angel fire my good one out those lips that loves own hand did make breathed forth the sound that said i hate to me that languished for her sake but when she saw my woeful state straight in her heart did mercy come chiding that tongue that ever sweet was used in giving gentle doom and taught it thus anew to greet i hate she altered with an end that followed it as gentle day doth follow night who like a fiend from heaven to hell is flown away i hate from hate away she threw and saved my life saying not you poor soul the centre of my sinful earth    these rebel powers that thee array why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth painting thy outward walls so costly gay why so large cost having so short a lease dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend shall worms inheritors of this excess eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end then soul live thou upon thy servants loss and let that pine to aggravate thy store buy terms divine in selling hours of dross within be fed without be rich no more so shall thou feed on death that feeds on men and death once dead theres no more dying then my love is as a fever longing still for that which longer nurseth the disease feeding on that which doth preserve the ill the uncertain sickly appetite to please my reason the physician to my love angry that his prescriptions are not kept hath left me and i desperate now approve desire is death which physic did except past cure i am now reason is past care and franticmad with evermore unrest my thoughts and my discourse as madmens are at random from the truth vainly expressed for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright who art as black as hell as dark as night o me what eyes hath love put in my head which have no correspondence with true sight or if they have where is my judgment fled that censures falsely what they see aright if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote what means the world to say it is not so if it be not then love doth well denote loves eye is not so true as all mens no how can it o how can loves eye be true that is so vexed with watching and with tears no marvel then though i mistake my view the sun itself sees not till heaven clears o cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find canst thou o cruel say i love thee not when i against myself with thee partake do i not think on thee when i forgot am of my self all tyrant for thy sake who hateth thee that i do call my friend on whom frownst thou that i do fawn upon nay if thou lourst on me do i not spend revenge upon myself with present moan what merit do i in my self respect that is so proud thy service to despise when all my best doth worship thy defect commanded by the motion of thine eyes but love hate on for now i know thy mind those that can see thou lovst and i am blind o from what power hast thou this powerful might with insufficiency my heart to sway to make me give the lie to my true sight and swear that brightness doth not grace the day whence hast thou this becoming of things ill that in the very refuse of thy deeds there is such strength and warrantise of skill that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds who taught thee how to make me love thee more the more i hear and see just cause of hate o though i love what others do abhor with others thou shouldst not abhor my state if thy unworthiness raised love in me more worthy i to be beloved of thee love is too young to know what conscience is yet who knows not conscience is born of love then gentle cheater urge not my amiss lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove for thou betraying me i do betray my nobler part to my gross bodys treason my soul doth tell my body that he may triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason but rising at thy name doth point out thee as his triumphant prize proud of this pride he is contented thy poor drudge to be to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side no want of conscience hold it that i call her love for whose dear love i rise and fall in loving thee thou knowst i am forsworn but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing in act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn in vowing new hate after new love bearing but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee when i break twenty i am perjured most for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee and all my honest faith in thee is lost for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness or made them swear against the thing they see for i have sworn thee fair more perjured eye to swear against the truth so foul a lie cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep a maid of dians this advantage found and his lovekindling fire did quickly steep in a cold valleyfountain of that ground which borrowed from this holy fire of love a dateless lively heat still to endure and grew a seething bath which yet men prove against strange maladies a sovereign cure but at my mistress eye loves brand newfired the boy for trial needs would touch my breast i sick withal the help of bath desired and thither hied a sad distempered guest but found no cure the bath for my help lies where cupid got new fire my mistress eyes the little lovegod lying once asleep laid by his side his heartinflaming brand whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep came tripping by but in her maiden hand the fairest votary took up that fire which many legions of true hearts had warmed and so the general of hot desire was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed this brand she quenched in a cool well by which from loves fire took heat perpetual growing a bath and healthful remedy for men diseased but i my mistress thrall came there for cure and this by that i prove loves fire heats water water cools not love']"

       "\"I. From fairest creatures we desire increase, That thereby beauty's rose might never die, But as the riper should by time decease, His tender heir might bear his memory: But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes, Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, Making a famine where abundance lies, Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament, And only herald to the gaudy spring, Within thine own bud buriest thy content, And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding: Pity the world, or else this glutton be, To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee. II. When forty winters shall besiege thy brow, And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now, Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held: Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies, Where all the treasure of thy lusty days; To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes, Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise. How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use, If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,' Proving his beauty by succession thine! This were to be new made when thou art old, And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold. III. Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest Now is the time that face should form another; Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? Or who is he so fond will be the tomb, Of his self-love to stop posterity? Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee Calls back the lovely April of her prime; So thou through windows of thine age shalt see, Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time. But if thou live, remember'd not to be, Die single and thine image dies with thee. IV. Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy? Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend, And being frank she lends to those are free: Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse The bounteous largess given thee to give? Profitless usurer, why dost thou use So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live? For having traffic with thy self alone, Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive: Then how when nature calls thee to be gone, What acceptable audit canst thou leave? Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee, Which, used, lives th' executor to be. V. Those hours, that with gentle work did frame The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell, Will play the tyrants to the very same And that unfair which fairly doth excel; For never-resting time leads summer on To hideous winter, and confounds him there; Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone, Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where: Then were not summer's distillation left, A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft, Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was: But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet, Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet. VI. Then let not winter's ragged hand deface, In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd: Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd. That use is not forbidden usury, Which happies those that pay the willing loan; That's for thy self to breed another thee, Or ten times happier, be it ten for one; Ten times thy self were happier than thou art, If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee: Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart, Leaving thee living in posterity? Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir. VII. Lo! in the orient when the gracious light Lifts up his burning head, each under eye Doth homage to his new-appearing sight, Serving with looks his sacred majesty; And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill, Resembling strong youth in his middle age, Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still, Attending on his golden pilgrimage: But when from highmost pitch, with weary car, Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day, The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are From his low tract, and look another way: So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon: Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son. VIII. Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly? Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy: Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly, Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy? If the true concord of well-tuned sounds, By unions married, do offend thine ear, They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear. Mark how one string, sweet husband to another, Strikes each in each by mutual ordering; Resembling sire and child and happy mother, Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing: Whose speechless song being many, seeming one, Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.' IX. Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye, That thou consum'st thy self in single life? Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die, The world will wail thee like a makeless wife; The world will be thy widow and still weep That thou no form of thee hast left behind, When every private widow well may keep By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind: Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it; But beauty's waste hath in the world an end, And kept unused the user so destroys it. No love toward others in that bosom sits That on himself such murd'rous shame commits. X. For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any, Who for thy self art so unprovident. Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many, But that thou none lov'st is most evident: For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate, That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire, Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate Which to repair should be thy chief desire. O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind: Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love? Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind, Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove: Make thee another self for love of me, That beauty still may live in thine or thee. XI. As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st, In one of thine, from that which thou departest; And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st, Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest, Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase; Without this folly, age, and cold decay: If all were minded so, the times should cease And threescore year would make the world away. Let those whom nature hath not made for store, Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish: Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more; Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish: She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby, Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die. XII. When I do count the clock that tells the time, And see the brave day sunk in hideous night; When I behold the violet past prime, And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white; When lofty trees I see barren of leaves, Which erst from heat did canopy the herd, And summer's green all girded up in sheaves, Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard, Then of thy beauty do I question make, That thou among the wastes of time must go, Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake And die as fast as they see others grow; And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence. XIII. O! that you were your self; but, love you are No longer yours, than you your self here live: Against this coming end you should prepare, And your sweet semblance to some other give: So should that beauty which you hold in lease Find no determination; then you were Yourself again, after yourself's decease, When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. Who lets so fair a house fall to decay, Which husbandry in honour might uphold, Against the stormy gusts of winter's day And barren rage of death's eternal cold? O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know, You had a father: let your son say so. XIV. Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck; And yet methinks I have astronomy, But not to tell of good or evil luck, Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality; Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell, Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind, Or say with princes if it shall go well By oft predict that I in heaven find: But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive, And constant stars in them I read such art As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive, If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert'; Or else of thee this I prognosticate: 'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.' XV. When I consider every thing that grows Holds in perfection but a little moment, That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows Whereon the stars in secret influence comment; When I perceive that men as plants increase, Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky, Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease, And wear their brave state out of memory; Then the conceit of this inconstant stay Sets you most rich in youth before my sight, Where wasteful Time debateth with decay To change your day of youth to sullied night, And all in war with Time for love of you, As he takes from you, I engraft you new. XVI. But wherefore do not you a mightier way Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time? And fortify your self in your decay With means more blessed than my barren rhyme? Now stand you on the top of happy hours, And many maiden gardens, yet unset, With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers, Much liker than your painted counterfeit: So should the lines of life that life repair, Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen, Neither in inward worth nor outward fair, Can make you live your self in eyes of men. To give away yourself, keeps yourself still, And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill. XVII. Who will believe my verse in time to come, If it were fill'd with your most high deserts? Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts. If I could write the beauty of your eyes, And in fresh numbers number all your graces, The age to come would say 'This poet lies; Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.' So should my papers, yellow'd with their age, Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue, And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage And stretched metre of an antique song: But were some child of yours alive that time, You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme. XVIII. Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer's lease hath all too short a date: Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimm'd, And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd: But thy eternal summer shall not fade, Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st, Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade, When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st, So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. XIX. Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws, And make the earth devour her own sweet brood; Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws, And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood; Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets, And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time, To the wide world and all her fading sweets; But I forbid thee one most heinous crime: O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow, Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen; Him in thy course untainted do allow For beauty's pattern to succeeding men. Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong, My love shall in my verse ever live young. XX. A woman's face with nature's own hand painted, Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion; A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted With shifting change, as is false women's fashion: An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling, Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth; A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling, Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth. And for a woman wert thou first created; Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting, And by addition me of thee defeated, By adding one thing to my purpose nothing. But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure, Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure. XXI. So is it not with me as with that Muse, Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse, Who heaven itself for ornament doth use And every fair with his fair doth rehearse, Making a couplement of proud compare' With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems, With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare, That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems. O! let me, true in love, but truly write, And then believe me, my love is as fair As any mother's child, though not so bright As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air: Let them say more that like of hearsay well; I will not praise that purpose not to sell. XXII. My glass shall not persuade me I am old, So long as youth and thou are of one date; But when in thee time's furrows I behold, Then look I death my days should expiate. For all that beauty that doth cover thee, Is but the seemly raiment of my heart, Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me: How can I then be elder than thou art? O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary As I, not for myself, but for thee will; Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary As tender nurse her babe from faring ill. Presume not on th;heart when mine is slain, Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again. XXIII. As an unperfect actor on the stage, Who with his fear is put beside his part, Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage, Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart; So I, for fear of trust, forget to say The perfect ceremony of love's rite, And in mine own love's strength seem to decay, O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might. O! let my looks be then the eloquence And dumb presagers of my speaking breast, Who plead for love, and look for recompense, More than that tongue that more hath more express'd. O! learn to read what silent love hath writ: To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit. XXIV. Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd, Thy beauty's form in table of my heart; My body is the frame wherein 'tis held, And perspective it is best painter's art. For through the painter must you see his skill, To find where your true image pictur'd lies, Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still, That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes. Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done: Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee; Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art, They draw but what they see, know not the heart. XXV. Let those who are in favour with their stars Of public honour and proud titles boast, Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most. Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread But as the marigold at the sun's eye, And in themselves their pride lies buried, For at a frown they in their glory die. The painful warrior famoused for fight, After a thousand victories once foil'd, Is from the book of honour razed quite, And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd: Then happy I, that love and am belov'd, Where I may not remove nor be remov'd. XXVI. Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit, To thee I send this written embassage, To witness duty, not to show my wit: Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it, But that I hope some good conceit of thine In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it: Till whatsoever star that guides my moving, Points on me graciously with fair aspect, And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving, To show me worthy of thy sweet respect: Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee; Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me. XXVII. Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed, The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd; But then begins a journey in my head To work my mind, when body's work's expired: For then my thoughts--from far where I abide-- Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee, And keep my drooping eyelids open wide, Looking on darkness which the blind do see: Save that my soul's imaginary sight Presents thy shadow to my sightless view, Which, like a jewel (hung in ghastly night, Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new. Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind, For thee, and for myself, no quiet find. XXVIII. How can I then return in happy plight, That am debarre'd the benefit of rest? When day's oppression is not eas'd by night, But day by night and night by day oppress'd, And each, though enemies to either's reign, Do in consent shake hands to torture me, The one by toil, the other to complain How far I toil, still farther off from thee. I tell the day, to please him thou art bright, And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven: So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night, When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even. But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer, And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger. XXIX. When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes I all alone beweep my outcast state, And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, And look upon myself, and curse my fate, Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd, Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope, With what I most enjoy contented least; Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising, Haply I think on thee,-- and then my state, Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate,; For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings. XXX. When to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrance of things past, I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought, And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste: Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow, For precious friends hid in death's dateless night, And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe, And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight: Then can I grieve at grievances foregone, And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan, Which I new pay as if not paid before. But if the while I think on thee, dear friend, All losses are restor'd and sorrows end. XXXI. Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts, Which I by lacking have supposed dead; And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts, And all those friends which I thought buried. How many a holy and obsequious tear Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye, As interest of the dead, which now appear But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie! Thou art the grave where buried love doth live, Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone, Who all their parts of me to thee did give, That due of many now is thine alone: Their images I lov'd, I view in thee, And thou--all they--hast all the all of me. XXXII. If thou survive my well-contented day, When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover And shalt by fortune once more re-survey These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover, Compare them with the bett'ring of the time, And though they be outstripp'd by every pen, Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme, Exceeded by the height of happier men. O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought: 'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age, A dearer birth than this his love had brought, To march in ranks of better equipage: But since he died and poets better prove, Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'. XXXIII. Full many a glorious morning have I seen Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye, Kissing with golden face the meadows green, Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy; Anon permit the basest clouds to ride With ugly rack on his celestial face, And from the forlorn world his visage hide, Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace: Even so my sun one early morn did shine, With all triumphant splendour on my brow; But out! alack! he was but one hour mine, The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now. Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth; Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth. XXXIV. Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day, And make me travel forth without my cloak, To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way, Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke? 'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break, To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face, For no man well of such a salve can speak, That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace: Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief; Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss: The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief To him that bears the strong offence's cross. Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds, And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds. XXXV. No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done: Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud: Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud. All men make faults, and even I in this, Authorizing thy trespass with compare, Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss, Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are; For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,-- Thy adverse party is thy advocate,-- And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence: Such civil war is in my love and hate, That I an accessary needs must be, To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me. XXXVI. Let me confess that we two must be twain, Although our undivided loves are one: So shall those blots that do with me remain, Without thy help, by me be borne alone. In our two loves there is but one respect, Though in our lives a separable spite, Which though it alter not love's sole effect, Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight. I may not evermore acknowledge thee, Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame, Nor thou with public kindness honour me, Unless thou take that honour from thy name: But do not so, I love thee in such sort, As thou being mine, mine is thy good report. XXXVII. As a decrepit father takes delight To see his active child do deeds of youth, So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite, Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth; For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit, Or any of these all, or all, or more, Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit, I make my love engrafted, to this store: So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd, Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give That I in thy abundance am suffic'd, And by a part of all thy glory live. Look what is best, that best I wish in thee: This wish I have; then ten times happy me! XXXVIII. How can my muse want subject to invent, While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse Thine own sweet argument, too excellent For every vulgar paper to rehearse? O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me Worthy perusal stand against thy sight; For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee, When thou thy self dost give invention light? Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth Than those old nine which rhymers invocate; And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth Eternal numbers to outlive long date. If my slight muse do please these curious days, The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise. XXXIX. O! how thy worth with manners may I sing, When thou art all the better part of me? What can mine own praise to mine own self bring? And what is't but mine own when I praise thee? Even for this, let us divided live, And our dear love lose name of single one, That by this separation I may give That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone. O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove, Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave, To entertain the time with thoughts of love, Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive, And that thou teachest how to make one twain, By praising him here who doth hence remain. XL. Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all; What hast thou then more than thou hadst before? No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call; All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more. Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest, I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest; But yet be blam'd, if thou thy self deceivest By wilful taste of what thyself refusest. I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief, Although thou steal thee all my poverty: And yet, love knows it is a greater grief To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury. Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows, Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes. XLI. Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits, When I am sometime absent from thy heart, Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits, For still temptation follows where thou art. Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won, Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd; And when a woman woos, what woman's son Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd? Ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear, And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth, Who lead thee in their riot even there Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:-- Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee, Thine by thy beauty being false to me. XLII. That thou hast her it is not all my grief, And yet it may be said I loved her dearly; That she hath thee is of my wailing chief, A loss in love that touches me more nearly. Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye: Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her; And for my sake even so doth she abuse me, Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her. If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain, And losing her, my friend hath found that loss; Both find each other, and I lose both twain, And both for my sake lay on me this cross: But here's the joy; my friend and I are one; Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone. XLIII. When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see, For all the day they view things unrespected; But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee, And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed. Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright, How would thy shadow's form form happy show To the clear day with thy much clearer light, When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so! How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made By looking on thee in the living day, When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay! All days are nights to see till I see thee, And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me. XLIV. If the dull substance of my flesh were thought, Injurious distance should not stop my way; For then despite of space I would be brought, From limits far remote, where thou dost stay. No matter then although my foot did stand Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee; For nimble thought can jump both sea and land, As soon as think the place where he would be. But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought, To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone, But that so much of earth and water wrought, I must attend, time's leisure with my moan; Receiving nought by elements so slow But heavy tears, badges of either's woe. XLV. The other two, slight air, and purging fire Are both with thee, wherever I abide; The first my thought, the other my desire, These present-absent with swift motion slide. For when these quicker elements are gone In tender embassy of love to thee, My life, being made of four, with two alone Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy; Until life's composition be recur'd By those swift messengers return'd from thee, Who even but now come back again, assur'd, Of thy fair health, recounting it to me: This told, I joy; but then no longer glad, I send them back again, and straight grow sad. XLVI. Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war, How to divide the conquest of thy sight; Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar, My heart mine eye the freedom of that right. My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,-- A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes-- But the defendant doth that plea deny, And says in him thy fair appearance lies. To side this title is impannelled A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart; And by their verdict is determined The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part: As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part, And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart. XLVII. Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took, And each doth good turns now unto the other: When that mine eye is famish'd for a look, Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother, With my love's picture then my eye doth feast, And to the painted banquet bids my heart; Another time mine eye is my heart's guest, And in his thoughts of love doth share a part: So, either by thy picture or my love, Thy self away, art present still with me; For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move, And I am still with them, and they with thee; Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight. XLVIII. How careful was I when I took my way, Each trifle under truest bars to thrust, That to my use it might unused stay From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust! But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are, Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief, Thou best of dearest, and mine only care, Art left the prey of every vulgar thief. Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest, Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art, Within the gentle closure of my breast, From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part; And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear, For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear. XLIX. Against that time, if ever that time come, When I shall see thee frown on my defects, When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum, Call'd to that audit by advis'd respects; Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass, And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye, When love, converted from the thing it was, Shall reasons find of settled gravity; Against that time do I ensconce me here, Within the knowledge of mine own desert, And this my hand, against my self uprear, To guard the lawful reasons on thy part: To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws, Since why to love I can allege no cause. L. How heavy do I journey on the way, When what I seek, my weary travel's end, Doth teach that ease and that repose to say, 'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!' The beast that bears me, tired with my woe, Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me, As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee: The bloody spur cannot provoke him on, That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide, Which heavily he answers with a groan, More sharp to me than spurring to his side; For that same groan doth put this in my mind, My grief lies onward, and my joy behind. LI. Thus can my love excuse the slow offence Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed: From where thou art why should I haste me thence? Till I return, of posting is no need. O! what excuse will my poor beast then find, When swift extremity can seem but slow? Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind, In winged speed n:motion shall I know, Then can no horse with my desire keep pace; Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made, Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race; But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,-- 'Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow, Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.' LII. So am I as the rich, whose blessed key, Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure, The which he will not every hour survey, For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure. Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare, Since, seldom coming in that long year set, Like stones of worth they thinly placed are, Or captain jewels in the carcanet. So is the time that keeps you as my chest, Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide, To make some special instant special-blest, By new unfolding his imprison'd pride. Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope, Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope. LIII. What is your substance, whereof are you made, That millions of strange shadows on you tend? Since every one, hath every one, one shade, And you but one, can every shadow lend. Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit Is poorly imitated after you; On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set, And you in Grecian tires are painted new: Speak of the spring, and foison of the year, The one doth shadow of your beauty show, The other as your bounty doth appear; And you in every blessed shape we know. In all external grace you have some part, But you like none, none you, for constant heart. LIV. O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which truth doth give. The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem For that sweet odour, which doth in it live. The canker blooms have full as deep a dye As the perfumed tincture of the roses. Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly When summer's breath their masked buds discloses: But, for their virtue only is their show, They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade; Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so; Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made: And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth, When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth. LV. Not marble, nor the gilded monuments Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme; But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time. When wasteful war shall statues overturn, And broils root out the work of masonry, Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn The living record of your memory. 'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room Even in the eyes of all posterity That wear this world out to the ending doom. So, till the judgment that yourself arise, You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes. LVI. Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said Thy edge should blunter be than appetite, Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd, To-morrow sharpened in his former might: So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness, To-morrow see again, and do not kill The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness. Let this sad interim like the ocean be Which parts the shore, where two contracted new Come daily to the banks, that when they see Return of love, more blest may be the view; Or call it winter, which being full of care, Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare. LVII. Being your slave what should I do but tend, Upon the hours, and times of your desire? I have no precious time at all to spend; Nor services to do, till you require. Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour, Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you, Nor think the bitterness of absence sour, When you have bid your servant once adieu; Nor dare I question with my jealous thought Where you may be, or your affairs suppose, But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought Save, where you are, how happy you make those. So true a fool is love, that in your will, Though you do anything, he thinks no ill. LVIII. That god forbid, that made me first your slave, I should in thought control your times of pleasure, Or at your hand the account of hours to crave, Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure! O! let me suffer, being at your beck, The imprison'd absence of your liberty; And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check, Without accusing you of injury. Be where you list, your charter is so strong That you yourself may privilage your time To what you will; to you it doth belong Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime. I am to wait, though waiting so be hell, Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well. LIX. If there be nothing new, but that which is Hath been before, how are our brains beguil'd, Which labouring for invention bear amiss The second burthen of a former child! O! that record could with a backward look, Even of five hundred courses of the sun, Show me your image in some antique book, Since mind at first in character was done! That I might see what the old world could say To this composed wonder of your frame; Wh'r we are mended, or wh'r better they, Or whether revolution be the same. O! sure I am the wits of former days, To subjects worse have given admiring praise. LX. Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, So do our minutes hasten to their end; Each changing place with that which goes before, In sequent toil all forwards do contend. Nativity, once in the main of light, Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd, Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight, And Time that gave doth now his gift confound. Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth And delves the parallels in beauty's brow, Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth, And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow: And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand. Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand. LXI. Is it thy will, thy image should keep open My heavy eyelids to the weary night? Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken, While shadows like to thee do mock my sight? Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee So far from home into my deeds to pry, To find out shames and idle hours in me, The scope and tenure of thy jealousy? O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great: It is my love that keeps mine eye awake: Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat, To play the watchman ever for thy sake: For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere, From me far off, with others all too near. LXII. Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye And all my soul, and all my every part; And for this sin there is no remedy, It is so grounded inward in my heart. Methinks no face so gracious is as mine, No shape so true, no truth of such account; And for myself mine own worth do define, As I all other in all worths surmount. But when my glass shows me myself indeed Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity, Mine own self-love quite contrary I read; Self so self-loving were iniquity. 'Tis thee,--myself,--that for myself I praise, Painting my age with beauty of thy days. LXIII. Against my love shall be as I am now, With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn; When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night; And all those beauties whereof now he's king Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight, Stealing away the treasure of his spring; For such a time do I now fortify Against confounding age's cruel knife, That he shall never cut from memory My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life: His beauty shall in these black lines be seen, And they shall live, and he in them still green. LXIV. When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age; When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz'd, And brass eternal slave to mortal rage; When I have seen the hungry ocean gain Advantage on the kingdom of the shore, And the firm soil win of the watery main, Increasing store with loss, and loss with store; When I have seen such interchange of state, Or state itself confounded, to decay; Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate-- That Time will come and take my love away. This thought is as a death which cannot choose But weep to have, that which it fears to lose. LXV. Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea, But sad mortality o'ersways their power, How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea, Whose action is no stronger than a flower? O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out, Against the wrackful siege of battering days, When rocks impregnable are not so stout, Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays? O fearful meditation! where, alack, Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid? Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back? Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid? O! none, unless this miracle have might, That in black ink my love may still shine bright. LXVI. Tired with all these, for restful death I cry, As to behold desert a beggar born, And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity, And purest faith unhappily forsworn, And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd, And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted, And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd, And strength by limping sway disabled And art made tongue-tied by authority, And folly--doctor-like--controlling skill, And simple truth miscall'd simplicity, And captive good attending captain ill: Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone, Save that, to die, I leave my love alone. LXVII. Ah! wherefore with infection should he live, And with his presence grace impiety, That sin by him advantage should achieve, And lace itself with his society? Why should false painting imitate his cheek, And steel dead seeming of his living hue? Why should poor beauty indirectly seek Roses of shadow, since his rose is true? Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is, Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins? For she hath no exchequer now but his, And proud of many, lives upon his gains. O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had In days long since, before these last so bad. LXVIII. Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn, When beauty lived and died as flowers do now, Before these bastard signs of fair were born, Or durst inhabit on a living brow; Before the golden tresses of the dead, The right of sepulchres, were shorn away, To live a second life on second head; Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay: In him those holy antique hours are seen, Without all ornament, itself and true, Making no summer of another's green, Robbing no old to dress his beauty new; And him as for a map doth Nature store, To show false Art what beauty was of yore. LXIX. Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend; All tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that due, Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend. Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd; But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own, In other accents do this praise confound By seeing farther than the eye hath shown. They look into the beauty of thy mind, And that in guess they measure by thy deeds; Then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind, To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds: But why thy odour matcheth not thy show, The soil is this, that thou dost common grow. LXX. That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect, For slander's mark was ever yet the fair; The ornament of beauty is suspect, A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air. So thou be good, slander doth but approve Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time; For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love, And thou present'st a pure unstained prime. Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd; Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise, To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd, If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show, Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe. LXXI. No longer mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell: Nay, if you read this line, remember not The hand that writ it, for I love you so, That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, If thinking on me then should make you woe. O! if,--I say you look upon this verse, When I perhaps compounded am with clay, Do not so much as my poor name rehearse; But let your love even with my life decay; Lest the wise world should look into your moan, And mock you with me after I am gone. LXXII. O! lest the world should task you to recite What merit lived in me, that you should love After my death,--dear love, forget me quite, For you in me can nothing worthy prove; Unless you would devise some virtuous lie, To do more for me than mine own desert, And hang more praise upon deceased I Than niggard truth would willingly impart: O! lest your true love may seem false in this That you for love speak well of me untrue, My name be buried where my body is, And live no more to shame nor me nor you. For I am shamed by that which I bring forth, And so should you, to love things nothing worth. LXXIII. That time of year thou mayst in me behold When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. In me thou see'st the twilight of such day As after sunset fadeth in the west; Which by and by black night doth take away, Death's second self, that seals up all in rest. In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire, That on the ashes of his youth doth lie, As the death-bed, whereon it must expire, Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by. This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong, To love that well, which thou must leave ere long. LXXIV. But be contented: when that fell arrest Without all bail shall carry me away, My life hath in this line some interest, Which for memorial still with thee shall stay. When thou reviewest this, thou dost review The very part was consecrate to thee: The earth can have but earth, which is his due; My spirit is thine, the better part of me: So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life, The prey of worms, my body being dead; The coward conquest of a wretch's knife, Too base of thee to be remembered,. The worth of that is that which it contains, And that is this, and this with thee remains. LXXV. So are you to my thoughts as food to life, Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground; And for the peace of you I hold such strife As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found. Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure; Now counting best to be with you alone, Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure: Sometime all full with feasting on your sight, And by and by clean starved for a look; Possessing or pursuing no delight, Save what is had, or must from you be took. Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day, Or gluttoning on all, or all away. LXXVI. Why is my verse so barren of new pride, So far from variation or quick change? Why with the time do I not glance aside To new-found methods, and to compounds strange? Why write I still all one, ever the same, And keep invention in a noted weed, That every word doth almost tell my name, Showing their birth, and where they did proceed? O! know sweet love I always write of you, And you and love are still my argument; So all my best is dressing old words new, Spending again what is already spent: For as the sun is daily new and old, So is my love still telling what is told. LXXVII. Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear, Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste; These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear, And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste. The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show Of mouthed graves will give thee memory; Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know Time's thievish progress to eternity. Look! what thy memory cannot contain, Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain, To take a new acquaintance of thy mind. These offices, so oft as thou wilt look, Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book. LXXVIII. So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse, And found such fair assistance in my verse As every alien pen hath got my use And under thee their poesy disperse. Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing And heavy ignorance aloft to fly, Have added feathers to the learned's wing And given grace a double majesty. Yet be most proud of that which I compile, Whose influence is thine, and born of thee: In others' works thou dost but mend the style, And arts with thy sweet graces graced be; But thou art all my art, and dost advance As high as learning, my rude ignorance. LXXIX. Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid, My verse alone had all thy gentle grace; But now my gracious numbers are decay'd, And my sick Muse doth give an other place. I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument Deserves the travail of a worthier pen; Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent He robs thee of, and pays it thee again. He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give, And found it in thy cheek: he can afford No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live. Then thank him not for that which he doth say, Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay. LXXX. O! how I faint when I of you do write, Knowing a better spirit doth use your name, And in the praise thereof spends all his might, To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame! But since your worth--wide as the ocean is,-- The humble as the proudest sail doth bear, My saucy bark, inferior far to his, On your broad main doth wilfully appear. Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat, Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride; Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat, He of tall building, and of goodly pride: Then if he thrive and I be cast away, The worst was this,--my love was my decay. LXXXI. Or I shall live your epitaph to make, Or you survive when I in earth am rotten; From hence your memory death cannot take, Although in me each part will be forgotten. Your name from hence immortal life shall have, Though I, once gone, to all the world must die: The earth can yield me but a common grave, When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie. Your monument shall be my gentle verse, Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read; And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse, When all the breathers of this world are dead; You still shall live,--such virtue hath my pen,-- Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men. LXXXII. I grant thou wert not married to my Muse, And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook The dedicated words which writers use Of their fair subject, blessing every book. Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue, Finding thy worth a limit past my praise; And therefore art enforced to seek anew Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days. And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd, What strained touches rhetoric can lend, Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend; And their gross painting might be better us'd Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus'd. LXXXIII. I never saw that you did painting need, And therefore to your fair no painting set; I found, or thought I found, you did exceed That barren tender of a poet's debt: And therefore have I slept in your report, That you yourself, being extant, well might show How far a modern quill doth come too short, Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow. This silence for my sin you did impute, Which shall be most my glory being dumb; For I impair not beauty being mute, When others would give life, and bring a tomb. There lives more life in one of your fair eyes Than both your poets can in praise devise. LXXXIV. Who is it that says most, which can say more, Than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you? In whose confine immured is the store Which should example where your equal grew. Lean penury within that pen doth dwell That to his subject lends not some small glory; But he that writes of you, if he can tell That you are you, so dignifies his story, Let him but copy what in you is writ, Not making worse what nature made so clear, And such a counterpart shall fame his wit, Making his style admired every where. You to your beauteous blessings add a curse, Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse. LXXXV. My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still, While comments of your praise richly compil'd, Reserve their character with golden quill, And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd. I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words, And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen' To every hymn that able spirit affords, In polish'd form of well-refined pen. Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,' And to the most of praise add something more; But that is in my thought, whose love to you, Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before. Then others, for the breath of words respect, Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect. LXXXVI. Was it the proud full sail of his great verse, Bound for the prize of all too precious you, That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse, Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew? Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write, Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead? No, neither he, nor his compeers by night Giving him aid, my verse astonished. He, nor that affable familiar ghost Which nightly gulls him with intelligence, As victors of my silence cannot boast; I was not sick of any fear from thence: But when your countenance fill'd up his line, Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine. LXXXVII. Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing, And like enough thou know'st thy estimate, The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing; My bonds in thee are all determinate. For how do I hold thee but by thy granting? And for that riches where is my deserving? The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting, And so my patent back again is swerving. Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing, Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking; So thy great gift, upon misprision growing, Comes home again, on better judgement making. Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter, In sleep a king, but waking no such matter. LXXXVIII. When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light, And place my merit in the eye of scorn, Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight, And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn. With mine own weakness, being best acquainted, Upon thy part I can set down a story Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted; That thou in losing me shalt win much glory: And I by this will be a gainer too; For bending all my loving thoughts on thee, The injuries that to myself I do, Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me. Such is my love, to thee I so belong, That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong. LXXXIX. Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault, And I will comment upon that offence: Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt, Against thy reasons making no defence. Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill, To set a form upon desired change, As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will, I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange; Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell, Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong, And haply of our old acquaintance tell. For thee, against my self I'll vow debate, For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate. XC. Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now; Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross, Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow, And do not drop in for an after-loss: Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow, Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe; Give not a windy night a rainy morrow, To linger out a purpos'd overthrow. If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last, When other petty griefs have done their spite, But in the onset come: so shall I taste At first the very worst of fortune's might; And other strains of woe, which now seem woe, Compar'd with loss of thee, will not seem so. XCI. Some glory in their birth, some in their skill, Some in their wealth, some in their body's force, Some in their garments though new-fangled ill; Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse; And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure, Wherein it finds a joy above the rest: But these particulars are not my measure, All these I better in one general best. Thy love is better than high birth to me, Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs, Of more delight than hawks and horses be; And having thee, of all men's pride I boast: Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take All this away, and me most wretchcd make. XCII. But do thy worst to steal thyself away, For term of life thou art assured mine; And life no longer than thy love will stay, For it depends upon that love of thine. Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs, When in the least of them my life hath end. I see a better state to me belongs Than that which on thy humour doth depend: Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind, Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie. O! what a happy title do I find, Happy to have thy love, happy to die! But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot? Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not. XCIII. So shall I live, supposing thou art true, Like a deceived husband; so love's face May still seem love to me, though alter'd new; Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place: For there can live no hatred in thine eye, Therefore in that I cannot know thy change. In many's looks, the false heart's history Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange. But heaven in thy creation did decree That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell; Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be, Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell. How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow, If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show! XCIV. They that have power to hurt, and will do none, That do not do the thing they most do show, Who, moving others, are themselves as stone, Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow; They rightly do inherit heaven's graces, And husband nature's riches from expense; They are the lords and owners of their faces, Others, but stewards of their excellence. The summer's flower is to the summer sweet, Though to itself, it only live and die, But if that flower with base infection meet, The basest weed outbraves his dignity: For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds; Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds. XCV. How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose, Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name! O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose. That tongue that tells the story of thy days, Making lascivious comments on thy sport, Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise; Naming thy name, blesses an ill report. O! what a mansion have those vices got Which for their habitation chose out thee, Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot And all things turns to fair that eyes can see! Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege; The hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge. XCVI. Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness; Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport; Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less: Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort. As on the finger of a throned queen The basest jewel will be well esteem'd, So are those errors that in thee are seen To truths translated, and for true things deem'd. How many lambs might the stern wolf betray, If like a lamb he could his looks translate! How many gazers mightst thou lead away, if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state! But do not so; I love thee in such sort, As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report. XCVII. How like a winter hath my absence been From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year! What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen! What old December's bareness everywhere! And yet this time removed was summer's time; The teeming autumn, big with rich increase, Bearing the wanton burden of the prime, Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease: Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit; For summer and his pleasures wait on thee, And, thou away, the very birds are mute: Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer, That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near. XCVIII. From you have I been absent in the spring, When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim, Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing, That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him. Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell Of different flowers in odour and in hue, Could make me any summer's story tell, Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew: Nor did I wonder at the lily's white, Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose; They were but sweet, but figures of delight, Drawn after you, you pattern of all those. Yet seem'd it winter still, and you away, As with your shadow I with these did play. XCIX. The forward violet thus did I chide: Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells, If not from my love's breath? The purple pride Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd. The lily I condemned for thy hand, And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair; The roses fearfully on thorns did stand, One blushing shame, another white despair; A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both, And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath; But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth A vengeful canker eat him up to death. More flowers I noted, yet I none could see, But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee. C. Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long, To speak of that which gives thee all thy might? Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song, Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light? Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem, In gentle numbers time so idly spent; Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem And gives thy pen both skill and argument. Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey, If Time have any wrinkle graven there; If any, be a satire to decay, And make time's spoils despised every where. Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life, So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife. CI. O truant Muse what shall be thy amends For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd? Both truth and beauty on my love depends; So dost thou too, and therein dignified. Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say, 'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd; Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay; But best is best, if never intermix'd'? Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb? Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee To make him much outlive a gilded tomb And to be prais'd of ages yet to be. Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how To make him seem long hence as he shows now. CII. My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming; I love not less, though less the show appear; That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming, The owner's tongue doth publish every where. Our love was new, and then but in the spring, When I was wont to greet it with my lays; As Philomel in summer's front doth sing, And stops her pipe in growth of riper days: Not that the summer is less pleasant now Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night, But that wild music burthens every bough, And sweets grown common lose their dear delight. Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue: Because I would not dull you with my song. CIII. Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth, That having such a scope to show her pride, The argument, all bare, is of more worth Than when it hath my added praise beside! O! blame me not, if I no more can write! Look in your glass, and there appears a face That over-goes my blunt invention quite, Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace. Were it not sinful then, striving to mend, To mar the subject that before was well? For to no other pass my verses tend Than of your graces and your gifts to tell; And more, much more, than in my verse can sit, Your own glass shows you when you look in it. CIV. To me, fair friend, you never can be old, For as you were when first your eye I ey'd, Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold, Have from the forests shook three summers' pride, Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd, In process of the seasons have I seen, Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd, Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green. Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand, Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd; So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand, Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd: For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred: Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead. CV. Let not my love be call'd idolatry, Nor my beloved as an idol show, Since all alike my songs and praises be To one, of one, still such, and ever so. Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind, Still constant in a wondrous excellence; Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd, One thing expressing, leaves out difference. 'Fair, kind, and true,' is all my argument, 'Fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words; And in this change is my invention spent, Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords. Fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone, Which three till now, never kept seat in one. CVI. When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights, And beauty making beautiful old rime, In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights, Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best, Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, I see their antique pen would have express'd Even such a beauty as you master now. So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time, all you prefiguring; And for they looked but with divining eyes, They had not skill enough your worth to sing: For we, which now behold these present days, Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise. CVII. Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul Of the wide world dreaming on things to come, Can yet the lease of my true love control, Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom. The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd, And the sad augurs mock their own presage; Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd, And peace proclaims olives of endless age. Now with the drops of this most balmy time, My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes, Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime, While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes: And thou in this shalt find thy monument, When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent. CVIII. What's in the brain, that ink may character, Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit? What's new to speak, what now to register, That may express my love, or thy dear merit? Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine, I must each day say o'er the very same; Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine, Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name. So that eternal love in love's fresh case, Weighs not the dust and injury of age, Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place, But makes antiquity for aye his page; Finding the first conceit of love there bred, Where time and outward form would show it dead. CIX. O! never say that I was false of heart, Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify, As easy might I from my self depart As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie: That is my home of love: if I have rang'd, Like him that travels, I return again; Just to the time, not with the time exchang'd, So that myself bring water for my stain. Never believe though in my nature reign'd, All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood, That it could so preposterously be stain'd, To leave for nothing all thy sum of good; For nothing this wide universe I call, Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all. CX. Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there, And made my self a motley to the view, Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear, Made old offences of affections new; Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth Askance and strangely; but, by all above, These blenches gave my heart another youth, And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love. Now all is done, save what shall have no end: Mine appetite I never more will grind On newer proof, to try an older friend, A god in love, to whom I am confin'd. Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best, Even to thy pure and most most loving breast. CXI. O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide, The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, That did not better for my life provide Than public means which public manners breeds. Thence comes it that my name receives a brand, And almost thence my nature is subdu'd To what it works in, like the dyer's hand: Pity me, then, and wish I were renew'd; Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink, Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection; No bitterness that I will bitter think, Nor double penance, to correct correction. Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye, Even that your pity is enough to cure me. CXII. Your love and pity doth the impression fill, Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow; For what care I who calls me well or ill, So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow? You are my all-the-world, and I must strive To know my shames and praises from your tongue; None else to me, nor I to none alive, That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong. In so profound abysm I throw all care Of others' voices, that my adder's sense To critic and to flatterer stopped are. Mark how with my neglect I do dispense: You are so strongly in my purpose bred, That all the world besides methinks are dead. CXIII. Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind; And that which governs me to go about Doth part his function and is partly blind, Seems seeing, but effectually is out; For it no form delivers to the heart Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch: Of his quick objects hath the mind no part, Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch; For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight, The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature, The mountain or the sea, the day or night: The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature. Incapable of more, replete with you, My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue. CXIV. Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you, Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery? Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true, And that your love taught it this alchemy, To make of monsters and things indigest Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble, Creating every bad a perfect best, As fast as objects to his beams assemble? O! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing, And my great mind most kingly drinks it up: Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing, And to his palate doth prepare the cup: If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin That mine eye loves it and doth first begin. CXV. Those lines that I before have writ do lie, Even those that said I could not love you dearer: Yet then my judgment knew no reason why My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer. But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings, Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents, Divert strong minds to the course of altering things; Alas! why fearing of Time's tyranny, Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,' When I was certain o'er incertainty, Crowning the present, doubting of the rest? Love is a babe, then might I not say so, To give full growth to that which still doth grow? CXVI. Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark, That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me prov'd, I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd. CXVII. Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all, Wherein I should your great deserts repay, Forgot upon your dearest love to call, Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day; That I have frequent been with unknown minds, And given to time your own dear-purchas'd right; That I have hoisted sail to all the winds Which should transport me farthest from your sight. Book both my wilfulness and errors down, And on just proof surmise, accumulate; Bring me within the level of your frown, But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate; Since my appeal says I did strive to prove The constancy and virtue of your love. CXVIII. Like as, to make our appetite more keen, With eager compounds we our palate urge; As, to prevent our maladies unseen, We sicken to shun sickness when we purge; Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness, To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding; And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness To be diseas'd, ere that there was true needing. Thus policy in love, to anticipate The ills that were not, grew to faults assur'd, And brought to medicine a healthful state Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur'd; But thence I learn and find the lesson true, Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you. CXIX. What potions have I drunk of Siren tears, Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within, Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears, Still losing when I saw myself to win! What wretched errors hath my heart committed, Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never! How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted, In the distraction of this madding fever! O benefit of ill! now I find true That better is, by evil still made better; And ruin'd love, when it is built anew, Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater. So I return rebuk'd to my content, And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent. CXX. That you were once unkind befriends me now, And for that sorrow, which I then did feel, Needs must I under my transgression bow, Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel. For if you were by my unkindness shaken, As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time; And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime. O! that our night of woe might have remember'd My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits, And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits! But that your trespass now becomes a fee; Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me. CXXI. 'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd, When not to be receives reproach of being; And the just pleasure lost, which is so deem'd Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing: For why should others' false adulterate eyes Give salutation to my sportive blood? Or on my frailties why are frailer spies, Which in their wills count bad what I think good? No, I am that I am, and they that level At my abuses reckon up their own: I may be straight though they themselves be bevel; By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown; Unless this general evil they maintain, All men are bad and in their badness reign. CXXII. Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain Full character'd with lasting memory, Which shall above that idle rank remain, Beyond all date; even to eternity: Or, at the least, so long as brain and heart Have faculty by nature to subsist; Till each to raz'd oblivion yield his part Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd. That poor retention could not so much hold, Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score; Therefore to give them from me was I bold, To trust those tables that receive thee more: To keep an adjunct to remember thee Were to import forgetfulness in me. CXXIII. No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change: Thy pyramids built up with newer might To me are nothing novel, nothing strange; They are but dressings of a former sight. Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire What thou dost foist upon us that is old; And rather make them born to our desire Than think that we before have heard them told. Thy registers and thee I both defy, Not wondering at the present nor the past, For thy records and what we see doth lie, Made more or less by thy continual haste. This I do vow and this shall ever be; I will be true despite thy scythe and thee. CXXIV. If my dear love were but the child of state, It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd, As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate, Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd. No, it was builded far from accident; It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls Under the blow of thralled discontent, Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls: It fears not policy, that heretic, Which works on leases of short-number'd hours, But all alone stands hugely politic, That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers. To this I witness call the fools of time, Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime. CXXV. Were't aught to me I bore the canopy, With my extern the outward honouring, Or laid great bases for eternity, Which proves more short than waste or ruining? Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour Lose all and more by paying too much rent For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour, Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent? No; let me be obsequious in thy heart, And take thou my oblation, poor but free, Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art, But mutual render, only me for thee. Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul When most impeach'd, stands least in thy control. CXXVI. O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his fickle hour; Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st. If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack, As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back, She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill. Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure! She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure: Her audit (though delayed) answered must be, And her quietus is to render thee. CXXVII. In the old age black was not counted fair, Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name; But now is black beauty's successive heir, And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame: For since each hand hath put on Nature's power, Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face, Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower, But is profan'd, if not lives in disgrace. Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black, Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack, Sland'ring creation with a false esteem: Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe, That every tongue says beauty should look so. CXXXIII. How oft when thou, my music, music play'st, Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st The wiry concord that mine ear confounds, Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap, To kiss the tender inward of thy hand, Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap, At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand! To be so tickled, they would change their state And situation with those dancing chips, O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait, Making dead wood more bless'd than living lips. Since saucy jacks so happy are in this, Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss. CXXIX. The expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action: and till action, lust Is perjur'd, murderous, bloody, full of blame, Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust; Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight; Past reason hunted; and no sooner had, Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait, On purpose laid to make the taker mad: Mad in pursuit and in possession so; Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme; A bliss in proof,-- and prov'd, a very woe; Before, a joy propos'd; behind a dream. All this the world well knows; yet none knows well To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell. CXXX. My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red, than her lips red: If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damask'd, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound: I grant I never saw a goddess go,-- My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground: And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare, As any she belied with false compare. CXXXI. Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art, As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel; For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel. Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold, Thy face hath not the power to make love groan; To say they err I dare not be so bold, Although I swear it to myself alone. And to be sure that is not false I swear, A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face, One on another's neck, do witness bear Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place. In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds, And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds. CXXXII. Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me, Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain, Have put on black and loving mourners be, Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain. And truly not the morning sun of heaven Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east, Nor that full star that ushers in the even, Doth half that glory to the sober west, As those two mourning eyes become thy face: O! let it then as well beseem thy heart To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace, And suit thy pity like in every part. Then will I swear beauty herself is black, And all they foul that thy complexion lack. CXXXIII. Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan For that deep wound it gives my friend and me! Is't not enough to torture me alone, But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be? Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken, And my next self thou harder hast engross'd: Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken; A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross'd: Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward, But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail; Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard; Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail: And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee, Perforce am thine, and all that is in me. CXXXIV. So, now I have confess'd that he is thine, And I my self am mortgag'd to thy will, Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still: But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free, For thou art covetous, and he is kind; He learn'd but surety-like to write for me, Under that bond that him as fast doth bind. The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take, Thou usurer, that putt'st forth all to use, And sue a friend came debtor for my sake; So him I lose through my unkind abuse. Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me: He pays the whole, and yet am I not free. CXXXV. Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,' And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus; More than enough am I that vex'd thee still, To thy sweet will making addition thus. Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious, Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine? Shall will in others seem right gracious, And in my will no fair acceptance shine? The sea, all water, yet receives rain still, And in abundance addeth to his store; So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will' One will of mine, to make thy large will more. Let no unkind 'No' fair beseechers kill; Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.' CXXXVI. If thy soul check thee that I come so near, Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will', And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there; Thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil. 'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love, Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one. In things of great receipt with ease we prove Among a number one is reckon'd none: Then in the number let me pass untold, Though in thy store's account I one must be; For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold That nothing me, a something sweet to thee: Make but my name thy love, and love that still, And then thou lov'st me for my name is 'Will.' CXXXVII. Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes, That they behold, and see not what they see? They know what beauty is, see where it lies, Yet what the best is take the worst to be. If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks, Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride, Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks, Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied? Why should my heart think that a several plot, Which my heart knows the wide world's common place? Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not, To put fair truth upon so foul a face? In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd, And to this false plague are they now transferr'd. CXXXVIII. When my love swears that she is made of truth, I do believe her though I know she lies, That she might think me some untutor'd youth, Unlearned in the world's false subtleties. Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, Although she knows my days are past the best, Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue: On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed: But wherefore says she not she is unjust? And wherefore say not I that I am old? O! love's best habit is in seeming trust, And age in love, loves not to have years told: Therefore I lie with her, and she with me, And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be. CXXXIX. O! call not me to justify the wrong That thy unkindness lays upon my heart; Wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue: Use power with power, and slay me not by art, Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight, Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside: What need'st thou wound with cunning, when thy might Is more than my o'erpress'd defence can bide? Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows Her pretty looks have been mine enemies; And therefore from my face she turns my foes, That they elsewhere might dart their injuries: Yet do not so; but since I am near slain, Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain. CXL. Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain; Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express The manner of my pity-wanting pain. If I might teach thee wit, better it were, Though not to love, yet, love to tell me so;-- As testy sick men, when their deaths be near, No news but health from their physicians know;-- For, if I should despair, I should grow mad, And in my madness might speak ill of thee; Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad, Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be. That I may not be so, nor thou belied, Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide. CXLI. In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes, For they in thee a thousand errors note; But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise, Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote. Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted; Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone, Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited To any sensual feast with thee alone: But my five wits nor my five senses can Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee, Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man, Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be: Only my plague thus far I count my gain, That she that makes me sin awards me pain. CXLII. Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate, Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving: O! but with mine compare thou thine own state, And thou shalt find it merits not reproving; Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine, That have profan'd their scarlet ornaments And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine, Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents. Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lov'st those Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee: Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows, Thy pity may deserve to pitied be. If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide, By self-example mayst thou be denied! CXLIII. Lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch One of her feather'd creatures broke away, Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch In pursuit of the thing she would have stay; Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase, Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent To follow that which flies before her face, Not prizing her poor infant's discontent; So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee, Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind; But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me, And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind; So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,' If thou turn back and my loud crying still. CXLIV. Two loves I have of comfort and despair, Which like two spirits do suggest me still: The better angel is a man right fair, The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill. To win me soon to hell, my female evil, Tempteth my better angel from my side, And would corrupt my saint to be a devil, Wooing his purity with her foul pride. And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend, Suspect I may, yet not directly tell; But being both from me, both to each friend, I guess one angel in another's hell: Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt, Till my bad angel fire my good one out. CXLV. Those lips that Love's own hand did make, Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate', To me that languish'd for her sake: But when she saw my woeful state, Straight in her heart did mercy come, Chiding that tongue that ever sweet Was us'd in giving gentle doom; And taught it thus anew to greet; 'I hate' she alter'd with an end, That followed it as gentle day, Doth follow night, who like a fiend From heaven to hell is flown away. 'I hate', from hate away she threw, And sav'd my life, saying 'not you'. CXLVI. Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth, My sinful earth these rebel powers array, Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth, Painting thy outward walls so costly gay? Why so large cost, having so short a lease, Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend? Shall worms, inheritors of this excess, Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end? Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss, And let that pine to aggravate thy store; Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross; Within be fed, without be rich no more: So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men, And Death once dead, there's no more dying then. CXLVII. My love is as a fever longing still, For that which longer nurseth the disease; Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill, The uncertain sickly appetite to please. My reason, the physician to my love, Angry that his prescriptions are not kept, Hath left me, and I desperate now approve Desire is death, which physic did except. Past cure I am, now Reason is past care, And frantic-mad with evermore unrest; My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are, At random from the truth vainly express'd; For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright, Who art as black as hell, as dark as night. CXLVIII. O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head, Which have no correspondence with true sight; Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled, That censures falsely what they see aright? If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote, What means the world to say it is not so? If it be not, then love doth well denote Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no, How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true, That is so vexed with watching and with tears? No marvel then, though I mistake my view; The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears. O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind, Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find. CXLIX. Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not, When I against myself with thee partake? Do I not think on thee, when I forgot Am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake? Who hateth thee that I do call my friend, On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon, Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend Revenge upon myself with present moan? What merit do I in my self respect, That is so proud thy service to despise, When all my best doth worship thy defect, Commanded by the motion of thine eyes? But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind,; Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind. CL. O! from what power hast thou this powerful might, With insufficiency my heart to sway? To make me give the lie to my true sight, And swear that brightness doth not grace the day? Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill, That in the very refuse of thy deeds There is such strength and warrantise of skill, That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds? Who taught thee how to make me love thee more, The more I hear and see just cause of hate? O! though I love what others do abhor, With others thou shouldst not abhor my state: If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me, More worthy I to be belov'd of thee. CLI. Love is too young to know what conscience is, Yet who knows not conscience is born of love? Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss, Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove: For, thou betraying me, I do betray My nobler part to my gross body's treason; My soul doth tell my body that he may Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason, But rising at thy name doth point out thee, As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride, He is contented thy poor drudge to be, To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side. No want of conscience hold it that I call Her 'love,' for whose dear love I rise and fall. CLII. In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn, But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing; In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn, In vowing new hate after new love bearing: But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee, When I break twenty? I am perjur'd most; For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee, And all my honest faith in thee is lost: For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness, Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy; And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness, Or made them swear against the thing they see; For I have sworn thee fair; more perjur'd I, To swear against the truth so foul a lie.! CLIII. Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep: A maid of Dian's this advantage found, And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep In a cold valley-fountain of that ground; Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love, A dateless lively heat, still to endure, And grew a seeting bath, which yet men prove Against strange maladies a sovereign cure. But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired, The boy for trial needs would touch my breast; I, sick withal, the help of bath desired, And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest, But found no cure, the bath for my help lies Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes. CLIV. The little Love-god lying once asleep, Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand, Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand The fairest votary took up that fire Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd; And so the general of hot desire Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd. This brand she quenched in a cool well by, Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual, Growing a bath and healthful remedy, For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall, Came there for cure and this by that I prove, Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.\""

leaves whose workmanship both man and beast deceives many would praise the sweet smell as she passed when twas the odour which her breath forth cast and there for honey bees have sought in vain and beat from thence have lighted there again about her neck hung chains of pebblestone which lightened by her neck like diamonds shone she ware no gloves for neither sun nor wind would burn or parch her hands but to her mind or warm or cool them for they took delight to play upon those hands they were so white buskins of shells all silvered used she and branched with blushing coral to the knee where

oerhead a lively vine of green sea agate spread where by one hand lightheaded bacchus hung and with the other wine from grapes out wrung of crystal shining fair the pavement was the town of sestos

first sight he kneeled but unto her devoutly prayed chaste hero to herself thus softly said were i the saint he worships i would hear him and as she spake those words came somewhat near him he started up she blushed as one ashamed wherewith leander much more was inflamed he touched her hand in touching it she trembled love deeply grounded hardly is dissembled these lovers parleyed by the touch of hands true love is mute and oft amazed stands thus while dumb signs their yielding hearts entangled the air with sparks of living fire was spangled and night deep drenched in misty acheron heaved up her head and half the world upon breathed darkness forth dark night is cupids day and now begins leander to display loves holy fire with words with sighs and tears which like sweet music entered heros ears and yet at every word she turned aside and always cut him off as he replied at last like to a bold sharp sophister with cheerful hope thus he accosted her fair creature let me speak without offence i would my rude words had the influence to lead thy thoughts as thy fair looks do mine then shouldst thou be his prisoner who is thine be not unkind and fair misshapen stuff are of behaviour boisterous and rough o shun me not but hear me ere you go god knows i cannot force love as you do my words shall be as spotless as my youth full of simplicity and naked truth this sacrifice whose sweet perfume descending from venus altar to your footsteps bending doth testify that you exceed her far to whom you offer and whose nun you are why should you worship her her you surpass as much as sparkling diamonds flaring glass a diamond set in lead his worth retains a heavenly nymph beloved of human swains receives no blemish but ofttimes more grace which makes me hope although i am but base base in respect of thee divine and pure dutiful service may thy love procure and i in duty will excel all other as thou in beauty dost exceed loves mother nor heaven nor thou were made to gaze upon as heaven preserves all things so save thou one a stately builded ship well rigged and tall the ocean maketh more majestical why vowest thou then to live in sestos here who on loves seas more glorious wouldst appear like untuned golden strings all women are which long time lie untouched will harshly jar vessels of brass oft handled brightly shine what difference betwixt the richest mine and basest

sacred priesthood makes thee loath tell me to whom madst thou that heedless oath to venus answered she and as she spake forth from those two tralucent cisterns brake a stream of liquid pearl which down her face made milkwhite paths whereon the gods might trace to joves high court he thus replied the rites in which loves beauteous empress most delights are banquets doric music midnight revel

perjury even sacrilege against her deity through regular and formal purity to expiate which sin kiss and shake hands such sacrifice as this venus demands thereat she smiled and did deny him so as put

to serve abandon fruitless cold virginity the gentle queen of loves sole enemy then shall you most resemble venus nun when venus sweet rites are performed and done flintbreasted pallas joys in single

accounted nice the richest corn dies if it be not reaped beauty alone is lost too warily kept these arguments he used and many more wherewith she yielded that was won before heros looks yielded but her words made war women are won when they begin to jar thus having swallowed cupids golden hook the more she strived the deeper was she strook yet evilly feigning anger strove she still and would be thought to grant against her will so having paused a while at last she said who taught thee rhetoric to deceive a maid ay me such words as these should i abhor and yet i like them for the orator with

hill far from the town where all is whist and still save that the sea playing on yellow sand sends forth a rattling murmur to the land whose sound allures the golden morpheus in silence of the night to visit us my turret stands and there god knows i play with venus swans and sparrows all the day a dwarfish beldam bears me company that hops about the chamber where i lie and spends the night that might be better spent in vain discourse and apish merriment come thither as she spake this her tongue tripped for unawares come thither from her slipped and suddenly her former colour changed and here and there her eyes through anger ranged and like a planet moving several ways at one self instant she poor soul assays loving not to love at all and every part strove to resist the motions of her heart and hands so pure so innocent nay such as might have made heaven stoop to have a touch did she uphold to venus and again vowed spotless chastity but all in vain cupid beats down her prayers with his wings her vows above the empty air he flings all deep enraged his sinewy bow he bent and shot a shaft that burning from him went wherewith she strooken looked so dolefully as made love sigh to see his tyranny and as she wept her tears to pearl he turned and wound them on his arm and for her mourned then towards the palace of the destinies laden with languishment and grief he flies and to those stern nymphs humbly made request both might enjoy each other and be blest but with a ghastly dreadful countenance threatening a thousand deaths at every glance they answered love nor would vouchsafe

country maid whose careless hair instead of pearl tadorn it glistered with dew as one that seemed to scorn it her breath as fragrant as the morning rose her mind pure and her tongue untaught to gloze yet proud she was for lofty pride that dwells in towered courts is oft in shepherds cells and too too well the fair vermilion knew and silver tincture of her cheeks that drew the love of every swain on her this god enamoured was and with his snaky rod did charm her nimble feet and made her stay the while upon a hillock down he lay and sweetly on his pipe began to play and with smooth speech her fancy to assay till in his twining arms he locked her fast and then he wooed with kisses and at last as shepherds do her on the ground he laid and tumbling in the grass he often strayed beyond the bounds of shame in being bold to eye those parts which no eye should behold and like an insolent commanding lover boasting his parentage would needs discover the way to new elysium but she whose only dower was her chastity having strivn in vain was now about to cry and crave the help of shepherds that were nigh herewith he stayed his fury and began to give her leave to rise away she ran after went mercury who used such cunning as she to hear his tale left off her running maids are not won by brutish force and might but speeches full of pleasure and delight and knowing hermes courted her was glad that she such loveliness and beauty had as could provoke his liking yet was mute and neither would deny nor grant his suit still vowed he love she wanting no excuse to feed him with delays as women use or thirsting after immortality all women are ambitious naturally imposed upon her lover such a task as he ought not perform nor yet she ask a draught of flowing nectar she requested wherewith the king of gods and men is feasted he ready to accomplish what she willed stole some from hebe hebe joves cup filled and gave it to his simple rustic love which being known as what is hid

cupid cupid for his sake to be revenged on jove did undertake and those on whom heaven earth and hell relies i mean the adamantine destinies he wounds with love and forced them equally to dote upon deceitful mercury they offered him the deadly fatal knife that shears the slender threads of human life at his fair feathered feet the engines laid which th earth from ugly chaos den upweighed these

began their golden reign murder rape war lust and treachery were with jove closed in stygian empery but long this blessed time continued not as soon as he his wished purpose got he reckless of his promise did despise the love of th everlasting destinies they seeing it both love and him abhorred and jupiter unto his place restored and but that learning in despite of fate will mount aloft and enter heaven gate and to the seat of jove itself advance hermes had slept in hell with ignorance yet as a punishment they added this that he and poverty should always kiss and to this day is every scholar poor gross gold from them runs headlong to the boor likewise the angry sisters thus deluded to venge themselves on hermes have concluded that midas brood shall sit in honours chair to which

suddenly repented and turned aside and to herself lamented as if her name and honour had been wronged by being possessed of him for whom she longed ay and she wished albeit not from her heart that he would leave her turret and depart the mirthful god of amorous pleasure smiled to see how he this captive nymph beguiled for hitherto he did but fan the fire and kept it down that it might mount the higher now waxed she jealous lest his love abated fearing her own thoughts made her to be hated therefore unto him hastily she goes and like light salmacis her body throws upon his bosom where with yielding eyes she offers up herself a sacrifice to slake his anger if he were displeased o what god would not therewith be appeased like aesops cock this jewel he enjoyed and as a brother with his sister toyed supposing nothing else was to be done now he her favour and good will had won but know you not that creatures wanting sense by nature have a mutual appetence and wanting organs to advance a step moved by loves force unto each other lep much more in subjects having intellect some hidden influence breeds like effect albeit leander rude in love and raw long dallying with hero nothing saw that might delight him more yet he suspected some amorous rites or other were neglected therefore unto his body hers he clung she fearing on the rushes to be flung strived with redoubled strength the more she strived the more a gentle pleasing heat revived which taught him all that elder lovers know and now the same gan so to scorch and glow as in plain terms yet cunningly he craved it love always makes those eloquent that have it she with a kind of granting put him by it and ever as he thought himself most nigh it like to the tree of tantalus she fled and seeming lavish saved her maidenhead neer king more sought to keep his diadem than hero this inestimable gem above our life we love a steadfast friend yet when a token of great worth we send we often kiss it often look thereon and stay the messenger that would be gone no marvel then though hero would not yield so soon to part from that she dearly held jewels being lost are found again this never tis lost but once and once lost lost forever now had the morn espied her lovers steeds whereat she starts puts on her purple weeds and red for anger that he stayed so long all headlong throws herself the clouds among and now leander fearing to be missed embraced her suddenly took leave and kissed long was he taking leave and loath to go and kissed again as lovers use to do sad hero wrung him by the hand and wept saying let your vows and promises be kept then standing at the door she turned about as loath to see leander going out and now the sun that through th horizon peeps as pitying these lovers downward creeps so that in silence of the cloudy night though it was morning did he take his flight but what the secret trusty night concealed leanders amorous habit soon revealed with cupids myrtle was his bonnet crowned about his arms the purple riband wound wherewith she wreathed her largely spreading hair nor could the youth abstain but he must wear the sacred ring wherewith she was endowed when first religious chastity she vowed which made his love through sestos to be known and thence unto abydos sooner blown than he could sail for incorporeal fame whose weight consists in nothing but her name is swifter than the wind whose tardy plumes are reeking water and dull earthly fumes home when he came he seemed not to be there but like exiled air thrust from his sphere set in a foreign place and straight from thence alcides like by mighty violence he would have chased away the swelling main that him from her unjustly did detain like as the sun in a diameter fires and inflames objects removed far and heateth kindly shining laterally so beauty sweetly quickens when tis nigh but being separated and removed burns where it cherished murders where it loved therefore even as an index to a book so to his mind was young leanders look o none but gods have power their love to hide affection by the countenance is descried the light of hidden fire itself discovers and love that is concealed betrays poor lovers his secret flame apparently was seen leanders father knew where he had been and for the same mildly rebuked his son thinking to quench the sparkles new begun but love resisted once grows passionate and nothing more than counsel lovers hate for as a hot proud horse highly disdains to have his head controlled but breaks the reins spits forth the ringled bit and with his hooves checks the submissive ground so he that loves the more he is restrained the worse he fares what is it now but mad leander dares o hero hero thus he cried full oft and then he got him to a rock aloft where having spied her tower long stared he ont and prayed the narrow toiling hellespont to part in twain that he might come and go but still the rising billows answered no with that he stripped him to the ivory skin and crying love i come leaped lively in whereat the sapphire visaged god grew proud and made his capering triton sound aloud imagining that ganymede displeased had left the heavens therefore on him he seized leander strived the waves about him wound and pulled him to the bottom where the ground was strewed with pearl and in low coral groves sweet singing mermaids sported with their loves on heaps of heavy gold and took great pleasure to spurn in careless sort the shipwrack treasure for here the stately azure palace stood where kingly neptune and his train abode the lusty god embraced him called him love and swore he never should return to jove but when he knew it was not ganymede for under water he was almost dead he heaved him up and looking on his face beat down the bold waves with his triple mace which mounted up intending to have kissed him and fell in drops like tears because they missed him leander being up began to swim and looking back saw neptune follow him whereat aghast the poor soul gan to cry o let me visit hero ere i die the god put helles bracelet on his arm and swore the sea should never do him harm he clapped his plump cheeks with his tresses played and smiling wantonly his love bewrayed he watched his arms and as they opened wide at every stroke betwixt them would he slide and steal a kiss and then run out and dance and as he turned cast many a lustful glance and threw him gaudy toys to please his eye and dive into the water and there pry upon his breast his thighs and every limb and up again and close beside him swim and talk of love leander made reply you are deceived i am no woman i thereat smiled neptune and then told a tale how that a shepherd sitting in a vale played with a boy so fair and kind as for his love both earth and heaven pined that of the cooling river durst not drink lest water nymphs should pull him from the brink and when he sported in the fragrant lawns goat footed satyrs and upstaring fauns would steal him thence ere half this tale was done ay me leander cried th enamoured sun that now should shine on thetis glassy bower descends upon my radiant heros tower o that these tardy arms of mine were wings and as he spake upon the waves he springs neptune was angry that he gave no ear and in his heart revenging malice bare he flung at him his mace but as it went he called it in for love made him repent the mace returning back his own hand hit as meaning to be venged for darting it when this fresh bleeding wound leander viewed his colour went and came as if he rued the grief which neptune felt in gentle breasts relenting thoughts remorse and pity rests and who have hard hearts and obdurate minds but vicious harebrained and illiterate hinds the god seeing him with pity to be moved thereon concluded that he was beloved love is too full of faith too credulous with folly and false hope deluding us wherefore leanders fancy to surprise to the rich ocean for gifts he flies tis wisdom to give much a gift prevails when deep persuading oratory fails by this leander being near the land cast down his weary feet and felt the sand breathless albeit he were he rested not till to the solitary tower he got and knocked and called at which celestial noise the longing heart of hero much more joys than nymphs and shepherds when the timbrel rings or crooked dolphin when the sailor sings she stayed not for her robes but straight arose and drunk with gladness to the door she goes where seeing a naked man she screeched for fear such sights as this to tender maids are rare and ran into the dark herself to hide rich jewels in the dark are soonest spied unto her was he led or rather drawn by those white limbs which sparkled through the lawn the nearer that he came the more she fled and seeking refuge slipped into her bed whereon leander sitting thus began through numbing cold all feeble faint and wan if not for love yet love for pity sake me in thy bed and maiden bosom take at least vouchsafe these arms some little room who hoping to embrace thee cheerly swum this head was beat with many a churlish billow and therefore let it rest upon thy pillow herewith affrighted hero shrunk away and in her lukewarm place leander lay whose lively heat like fire from heaven fet would animate gross clay and higher set the drooping thoughts of base declining souls than dreary mars carousing nectar bowls his hands he cast upon her like a snare she overcome with shame and sallow fear like chaste diana when actaeon spied her being suddenly betrayed dived down to hide her and as her silver body downward went with both her hands she made the bed a tent and in her own mind thought herself secure oercast with dim and darksome coverture and now she lets him whisper in her ear flatter entreat promise protest and swear yet ever as he greedily assayed to touch those dainties she the harpy played and every limb did as a soldier stout defend the fort and keep the foeman out for though the rising ivory mount he scaled which is with azure circling lines empaled much like a globe a globe may i term this by which love sails to regions full of bliss yet there with sisyphus he toiled in vain till gentle parley did the truce obtain wherein leander on her quivering breast breathless spoke something and sighed out the rest which so prevailed as he with small ado enclosed her in his arms and kissed her too and every kiss to her was as a charm and to leander as a fresh alarm so that the truce was broke and she alas poor silly maiden at his mercy was love is not full of pity as men say but deaf and cruel where he means to prey even as a bird which in our hands we wring forth plungeth and oft flutters with her wing she trembling strove this strife of hers like that which made the world another world begat of unknown joy treason was in her thought and cunningly to yield herself she sought seeming not won yet won she was at length in such wars women use but half their strength leander now like theban hercules entered the orchard of th hesperides whose fruit none rightly can describe but he that pulls or shakes it from the golden tree and now she wished this night were never done and sighed to think upon th approaching sun for much it grieved her that the bright daylight should know the pleasure of this blessed night and them like mars and erycine display both in each others arms chained as they lay again she knew not how to frame her look or speak to him who in a moment took that which so long so charily she kept and fain by stealth away she would have crept and to some corner secretly have gone leaving leander in the bed alone but as her naked feet were whipping out he on the sudden clinged her so about that mermaidlike unto the floor she slid one half appeared the other half was hid thus near the bed she blushing stood upright and from her countenance behold ye might a kind of twilight break which through the hair as from an orient cloud glimpsed here and there and round about the chamber this false morn brought forth the day before the day was born so heros ruddy cheek hero betrayed and her all naked to his sight displayed whence his admiring eyes more pleasure took than dis on heaps of gold fixing his look by this apollos golden harp began to sound forth music to the ocean which watchful hesperus no sooner heard but he the bright daybearing car prepared and ran before as harbinger of light and with his flaring beams mocked ugly night till she oercome with anguish shame and rage danged down to hell her loathsome carriage',\n",

       " 'i man being the servant and interpreter of nature can do and understand so much and so much only as he has observed in fact or in thought of the course of nature beyond this he neither knows anything nor can do anything ii neither the naked hand nor the understanding left to itself can effect much it is by instruments and helps that the work is done which are as much wanted for the understanding as for the hand and as the instruments of the hand either give motion or guide it so the instruments of the mind supply either suggestions for the understanding or cautions iii human knowledge and human power meet in one for where the cause is not known the effect cannot be produced nature to be commanded must be obeyed and that which in contemplation is as the cause is in operation as the rule iv towards the effecting of works all that man can do is to put together or put asunder natural bodies the rest is done by nature working within v the study of nature with a view to works is engaged in by the mechanic the mathematician the physician the alchemist and the magician but by all as things now are with slight endeavour and scanty success vi it would be an unsound fancy and selfcontradictory to expect that things which have never yet been done can be done except by means which have never yet been tried vii the productions of the mind and hand seem very numerous in books and manufactures but all this variety lies in an exquisite subtlety and derivations from a few things already known not in the number of axioms viii moreover the works already known are due to chance and experiment rather than to sciences for the sciences we now possess are merely systems for the nice ordering and setting forth of things already invented not methods of invention or directions for new works ix the cause and root of nearly all evils in the sciences is this — that while we falsely admire and extol the powers of the human mind we neglect to seek for its true helps x the subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of the senses and understanding so that all those specious meditations speculations and glosses in which men indulge are quite from the purpose only there is no one by to observe it xi as the sciences which we now have do not help us in finding out new works so neither does the logic which we now have help us in finding out new sciences xii the logic now in use serves rather to fix and give stability to the errors which have their foundation in commonly received notions than to help the search after truth so it does more harm than good xiii the syllogism is not applied to the first principles of sciences and is applied in vain to intermediate axioms being no match for the subtlety of nature it commands assent therefore to the proposition but does not take hold of the thing xiv the syllogism consists of propositions propositions consist of words words are symbols of notions therefore if the notions themselves which is the root of the matter are confused and overhastily abstracted from the facts there can be no firmness in the superstructure our only hope therefore lies in a true induction xv there is no soundness in our notions whether logical or physical substance quality action passion essence itself are not sound notions much less are heavy light dense rare moist dry generation corruption attraction repulsion element matter form and the like but all are fantastical and ill defined xvi our notions of less general species as man dog dove and of the immediate perceptions of the sense as hot cold black white do not materially mislead us yet even these are sometimes confused by the flux and alteration of matter and the mixing of one thing with another all the others which men have hitherto adopted are but wanderings not being abstracted and formed from things by proper methods xvii nor is there less of wilfulness and wandering in the construction of axioms than in the formations of notions not excepting even those very principles which are obtained by common induction but much more in the axioms and lower propositions educed by the syllogism xviii the discoveries which have hitherto been made in the sciences are such as lie close to vulgar notions scarcely beneath the surface in order to penetrate into the inner and further recesses of nature it is necessary that both notions and axioms be derived from things by a more sure and guarded way and that a method of intellectual operation be introduced altogether better and more certain xix there are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth the one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms and from these principles the truth of which it takes for settled and immovable proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of middle axioms and this way is now in fashion the other derives axioms from the senses and particulars rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all this is the true way but as yet untried xx the understanding left to itself takes the same course namely the former which it takes in accordance with logical order for the mind longs to spring up to positions of higher generality that it may find rest there and so after a little while wearies of experiment but this evil is increased by logic because of the order and solemnity of its disputations xxi the understanding left to itself in a sober patient and grave mind especially if it be not hindered by received doctrines tries a little that other way which is the right one but with little progress since the understanding unless directed and assisted is a thing unequal and quite unfit to contend with the obscurity of things xxii both ways set out from the senses and particulars and rest in the highest generalities but the difference between them is infinite for the one just glances at experiment and particulars in passing the other dwells duly and orderly among them the one again begins at once by establishing certain abstract and useless generalities the other rises by gradual steps to that which is prior and better known in the order of nature xxiii there is a great difference between the idols of the human mind and the ideas of the divine that is to say between certain empty dogmas and the true signatures and marks set upon the works of creation as they are found in nature xxiv it cannot be that axioms established by argumentation should avail for the discovery of new works since the subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of argument but axioms duly and orderly formed from particulars easily discover the way to new particulars and thus render sciences active xxv the axioms now in use having been suggested by a scanty and manipular experience and a few particulars of most general occurrence are made for the most part just large enough to fit and take these in and therefore it is no wonder if they do not lead to new particulars and if some opposite instance not observed or not known before chance to come in the way the axiom is rescued and preserved by some frivolous distinction whereas the truer course would be to correct the axiom itself xxvi the conclusions of human reason as ordinarily applied in matter of nature i call for the sake of distinction anticipations of nature as a thing rash or premature that reason which is elicited from facts by a just and methodical process i call interpretation of nature xxvii anticipations are a ground sufficiently firm for consent for even if men went mad all after the same fashion they might agree one with another well enough xxviii for the winning of assent indeed anticipations are far more powerful than interpretations because being collected from a few instances and those for the most part of familiar occurrence they straightway touch the understanding and fill the imagination whereas interpretations on the other hand being gathered here and there from very various and widely dispersed facts cannot suddenly strike the understanding and therefore they must needs in respect of the opinions of the time seem harsh and out of tune much as the mysteries of faith do xxix in sciences founded on opinions and dogmas the use of anticipations and logic is good for in them the object is to command assent to the proposition not to master the thing xxx though all the wits of all the ages should meet together and combine and transmit their labours yet will no great progress ever be made in science by means of anticipations because radical errors in the first concoction of the mind are not to be cured by the excellence of functions and remedies subsequent xxxi it is idle to expect any great advancement in science from the superinducing and engrafting of new things upon old we must begin anew from the very foundations unless we would revolve for ever in a circle with mean and contemptible progress xxxii the honour of the ancient authors and indeed of all remains untouched since the comparison i challenge is not of wits or faculties but of ways and methods and the part i take upon myself is not that of a judge but of a guide xxxiii this must be plainly avowed no judgment can be rightly formed either of my method or of the discoveries to which it leads by means of anticipations that is to say of the reasoning which is now in use since i cannot be called on to abide by the sentence of a tribunal which is itself on its trial xxxiv even to deliver and explain what i bring forward is no easy matter for things in themselves new will yet be apprehended with reference to what is old xxxv it was said by borgia of the expedition of the french into italy that they came with chalk in their hands to mark out their lodgings not with arms to force their way in i in like manner would have my doctrine enter quietly into the minds that are fit and capable of receiving it for confutations cannot be employed when the difference is upon first principles and very notions and even upon forms of demonstration xxxvi one method of delivery alone remains to us which is simply this we must lead men to the particulars themselves and their series and order while men on their side must force themselves for awhile to lay their notions by and begin to familiarise themselves with facts xxxvii the doctrine of those who have denied that certainty could be attained at all has some agreement with my way of proceeding at the first setting out but they end in being infinitely separated and opposed for the holders of that doctrine assert simply that nothing can be known i also assert that not much can be known in nature by the way which is now in use but then they go on to destroy the authority of the senses and understanding whereas i proceed to devise and supply helps for the same xxxviii the idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding and have taken deep root therein not only so beset mens minds that truth can hardly find entrance but even after entrance obtained they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults xxxix there are four classes of idols which beset mens minds to these for distinctions sake i have assigned names — calling the first class idols of the tribe the second idols of the cave the third idols of the marketplace the fourth idols of the theatre xl the formation of ideas and axioms by true induction is no doubt the proper remedy to be applied for the keeping off and clearing away of idols to point them out however is of great use for the doctrine of idols is to the interpretation of nature what the doctrine of the refutation of sophisms is to common logic xli the idols of the tribe have their foundation in human nature itself and in the tribe or race of men for it is a false assertion that the sense of man is the measure of things on the contrary all perceptions as well of the sense as of the mind are according to the measure of the individual and not according to the measure of the universe and the human understanding is like a false mirror which receiving rays irregularly distorts and discolours the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it xlii the idols of the cave are the idols of the individual man for every one besides the errors common to human nature in general has a cave or den of his own which refracts and discolours the light of nature owing either to his own proper and peculiar nature or to his education and conversation with others or to the reading of books and the authority of those whom he esteems and admires or to the differences of impressions accordingly as they take place in a mind preoccupied and predisposed or in a mind indifferent and settled or the like so that the spirit of man according as it is meted out to different individuals is in fact a thing variable and full of perturbation and governed as it were by chance whence it was well observed by heraclitus that men look for sciences in their own lesser worlds and not in the greater or common world xliii there are also idols formed by the intercourse and association of men with each other which i call idols of the marketplace on account of the commerce and consort of men there for it is by discourse that men associate and words are imposed according to the apprehension of the vulgar and therefore the ill and unfit choice of words wonderfully obstructs the understanding nor do the definitions or explanations wherewith in some things learned men are wont to guard and defend themselves by any means set the matter right but words plainly force and overrule the understanding and throw all into confusion and lead men away into numberless empty controversies and idle fancies xliv lastly there are idols which have immigrated into mens minds from the various dogmas of philosophies and also from wrong laws of demonstration these i call idols of the theatre because in my judgment all the received systems are but so many stageplays representing worlds of their own creation after an unreal and scenic fashion nor is it only of the systems now in vogue or only of the ancient sects and philosophies that i speak for many more plays of the same kind may yet be composed and in like artificial manner set forth seeing that errors the most widely different have nevertheless causes for the most part alike neither again do i mean this only of entire systems but also of many principles and axioms in science which by tradition credulity and negligence have come to be received but of these several kinds of idols i must speak more largely and exactly that the understanding may be duly cautioned xlv the human understanding is of its own nature prone to suppose the existence of more order and regularity in the world than it finds and though there be many things in nature which are singular and unmatched yet it devises for them parallels and conjugates and relatives which do not exist hence the fiction that all celestial bodies move in perfect circles spirals and dragons being except in name utterly rejected hence too the element of fire with its orb is brought in to make up the square with the other three which the sense perceives hence also the ratio of density of the socalled elements is arbitrarily fixed at ten to one and so on of other dreams and these fancies affect not dogmas only but simple notions also xlvi the human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself draws all things else to support and agree with it and though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side yet these it either neglects and despises or else by some distinction sets aside and rejects in order that by this great and pernicious predetermination the authority of its former conclusions may remain inviolate and therefore it was a good answer that was made by one who when they showed him hanging in a temple a picture of those who had paid their vows as having escaped shipwreck and would have him say whether he did not now acknowledge the power of the gods — aye asked he again but where are they painted that were drowned after their vows and such is the way of all superstition whether in astrology dreams omens divine judgments or the like wherein men having a delight in such vanities mark the events where they are fulfilled but where they fail though this happen much oftener neglect and pass them by but with far more subtlety does this mischief insinuate itself into philosophy and the sciences in which the first conclusion colours and brings into conformity with itself all that come after though far sounder and better besides independently of that delight and vanity which i have described it is the peculiar and perpetual error of the human intellect to be more moved and excited by affirmatives than by negatives whereas it ought properly to hold itself indifferently disposed towards both alike indeed in the establishment of any true axiom the negative instance is the more forcible of the two xlvii the human understanding is moved by those things most which strike and enter the mind simultaneously and suddenly and so fill the imagination and then it feigns and supposes all other things to be somehow though it cannot see how similar to those few things by which it is surrounded but for that going to and fro to remote and heterogeneous instances by which axioms are tried as in the fire the intellect is altogether slow and unfit unless it be forced thereto by severe laws and overruling authority xlviii the human understanding is unquiet it cannot stop or rest and still presses onward but in vain therefore it is that we cannot conceive of any end or limit to the world but always as of necessity it occurs to us that there is something beyond neither again can it be conceived how eternity has flowed down to the present day for that distinction which is commonly received of infinity in time past and in time to come can by no means hold for it would thence follow that one infinity is greater than another and that infinity is wasting away and tending to become finite the like subtlety arises touching the infinite divisibility of lines from the same inability of thought to stop but this inability interferes more mischievously in the discovery of causes for although the most general principles in nature ought to be held merely positive as they are discovered and cannot with truth be referred to a cause nevertheless the human understanding being unable to rest still seeks something prior in the order of nature and then it is that in struggling towards that which is further off it falls back upon that which is more nigh at hand namely on final causes which have relation clearly to the nature of man rather than to the nature of the universe and from this source have strangely defiled philosophy but he is no less an unskilled and shallow philosopher who seeks causes of that which is most general than he who in things subordinate and subaltern omits to do so xlix the human understanding is no dry light but receives an infusion from the will and affections whence proceed sciences which may be called sciences as one would for what a man had rather were true he more readily believes therefore he rejects difficult things from impatience of research sober things because they narrow hope the deeper things of nature from superstition the light of experience from arrogance and pride lest his mind should seem to be occupied with things mean and transitory things not commonly believed out of deference to the opinion of the vulgar numberless in short are the ways and sometimes imperceptible in which the affections colour and infect the understanding l but by far the greatest hindrance and aberration of the human understanding proceeds from the dullness incompetency and deceptions of the senses in that things which strike the sense outweigh things which do not immediately strike it though they be more important hence it is that speculation commonly ceases where sight ceases insomuch that of things invisible there is little or no observation hence all the working of the spirits inclosed in tangible bodies lies hid and unobserved of men so also all the more subtle changes of form in the parts of coarser substances which they commonly call alteration though it is in truth local motion through exceedingly small spaces is in like manner unobserved and yet unless these two things just mentioned be searched out and brought to light nothing great can be achieved in nature as far as the production of works is concerned so again the essential nature of our common air and of all bodies less dense than air which are very many is almost unknown for the sense by itself is a thing infirm and erring neither can instruments for enlarging or sharpening the senses do much but all the truer kind of interpretation of nature is effected by instances and experiments fit and apposite wherein the sense decides touching the experiment only and the experiment touching the point in nature and the thing itself li the human understanding is of its own nature prone to abstractions and gives a substance and reality to things which are fleeting but to resolve nature into abstractions is less to our purpose than to dissect her into parts as did the school of democritus which went further into nature than the rest matter rather than forms should be the object of our attention its configurations and changes of configuration and simple action and law of action or motion for forms are figments of the human mind unless you will call those laws of action forms lii such then are the idols which i call idols of the tribe and which take their rise either from the homogeneity of the substance of the human spirit or from its preoccupation or from its narrowness or from its restless motion or from an infusion of the affections or from the incompetency of the senses or from the mode of impression liii the idols of the cave take their rise in the peculiar constitution mental or bodily of each individual and also in education habit and accident of this kind there is a great number and variety but i will instance those the pointing out of which contains the most important caution and which have most effect in disturbing the clearness of the understanding liv men become attached to certain particular sciences and speculations either because they fancy themselves the authors and inventors thereof or because they have bestowed the greatest pains upon them and become most habituated to them but men of this kind if they betake themselves to philosophy and contemplations of a general character distort and colour them in obedience to their former fancies a thing especially to be noticed in aristotle who made his natural philosophy a mere bondservant to his logic thereby rendering it contentious and well nigh useless the race of chemists again out of a few experiments of the furnace have built up a fantastic philosophy framed with reference to a few things and gilbert also after he had employed himself most laboriously in the study and observation of the loadstone proceeded at once to construct an entire system in accordance with his favourite subject lv there is one principal and as it were radical distinction between different minds in respect of philosophy and the sciences which is this that some minds are stronger and apter to mark the differences of things others to mark their resemblances the steady and acute mind can fix its contemplations and dwell and fasten on the subtlest distinctions the lofty and discursive mind recognises and puts together the finest and most general resemblances both kinds however easily err in excess by catching the one at gradations the other at shadows lvi there are found some minds given to an extreme admiration of antiquity others to an extreme love and appetite for novelty but few so duly tempered that they can hold the mean neither carping at what has been well laid down by the ancients nor despising what is well introduced by the moderns this however turns to the great injury of the sciences and philosophy since these affectations of antiquity and novelty are the humours of partisans rather than judgments and truth is to be sought for not in the felicity of any age which is an unstable thing but in the light of nature and experience which is eternal these factions therefore must be abjured and care must be taken that the intellect be not hurried by them into assent lvii contemplations of nature and of bodies in their simple form break up and distract the understanding while contemplations of nature and bodies in their composition and configuration overpower and dissolve the understanding a distinction well seen in the school of leucippus and democritus as compared with the other philosophies for that school is so busied with the particles that it hardly attends to the structure while the others are so lost in admiration of the structure that they do not penetrate to the simplicity of nature these kinds of contemplation should therefore be alternated and taken by turns that so the understanding may be rendered at once penetrating and comprehensive and the inconveniences above mentioned with the idols which proceed from them may be avoided lviii let such then be our provision and contemplative prudence for keeping off and dislodging the idols of the cave which grow for the most part either out of the predominance of a favourite subject or out of an excessive tendency to compare or to distinguish or out of partiality for particular ages or out of the largeness or minuteness of the objects contemplated and generally let every student of nature take this as a rule — that whatever his mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction is to be held in suspicion and that so much the more care is to be taken in dealing with such questions to keep the understanding even and clear lix but the idols of the marketplace are the most troublesome of all idols which have crept into the understanding through the alliances of words and names for men believe that their reason governs words but it is also true that words react on the understanding and this it is that has rendered philosophy and the sciences sophistical and inactive now words being commonly framed and applied according to the capacity of the vulgar follow those lines of division which are most obvious to the vulgar understanding and whenever an understanding of greater acuteness or a more diligent observation would alter those lines to suit the true divisions of nature words stand in the way and resist the change whence it comes to pass that the high and formal discussions of learned men end oftentimes in disputes about words and names with which according to the use and wisdom of the mathematicians it would be more prudent to begin and so by means of definitions reduce them to order yet even definitions cannot cure this evil in dealing with natural and material things since the definitions themselves consist of words and those words beget others so that it is necessary to recur to individual instances and those in due series and order as i shall say presently when i come to the method and scheme for the formation of notions and axioms lx the idols imposed by words on the understanding are of two kinds they are either names of things which do not exist for as there are things left unnamed through lack of observation so likewise are there names which result from fantastic suppositions and to which nothing in reality corresponds or they are names of things which exist but yet confused and illdefined and hastily and irregularly derived from realities of the former kind are fortune the prime mover planetary orbits element of fire and like fictions which owe their origin to false and idle theories and this class of idols is more easily expelled because to get rid of them it is only necessary that all theories should be steadily rejected and dismissed as obsolete but the other class which springs out of a faulty and unskilful abstraction is intricate and deeply rooted let us take for example such a word as humid and see how far the several things which the word is used to signify agree with each other and we shall find the word humid to be nothing else than a mark loosely and confusedly applied to denote a variety of actions which will not bear to be reduced to any constant meaning for it both signifies that which easily spreads itself round any other body and that which in itself is indeterminate and cannot solidise and that which readily yields in every direction and that which easily divides and scatters itself and that which easily unites and collects itself and that which readily flows and is put in motion and that which readily clings to another body and wets it and that which is easily reduced to a liquid or being solid easily melts accordingly when you come to apply the word — if you take it in one sense flame is humid if in another air is not humid if in another fine dust is humid if in another glass is humid so that it is easy to see that the notion is taken by abstraction only from water and common and ordinary liquids without any due verification there are however in words certain degrees of distortion and error one of the least faulty kinds is that of names of substances especially of lowest species and welldeduced for the notion of chalk and of mud is good of earth bad a more faulty kind is that of actions as to generate to corrupt to alter the most faulty is of qualities except such as are the immediate objects of the sense as heavy light rare dense and the like yet in all these cases some notions are of necessity a little better than others in proportion to the greater variety of subjects that fall within the range of the human sense lxi but the idols of the theatre are not innate nor do they steal into the understanding secretly but are plainly impressed and received into the mind from the playbooks of philosophical systems and the perverted rules of demonstration to attempt refutations in this case would be merely inconsistent with what i have already said for since we agree neither upon principles nor upon demonstrations there is no place for argument and this is so far well inasmuch as it leaves the honour of the ancients untouched for they are no wise disparaged the question between them and me being only as to the way for as the saying is the lame man who keeps the right road outstrips the runner who takes a wrong one nay it is obvious that when a man runs the wrong way the more active and swift he is the further he will go astray but the course i propose for the discovery of sciences is such as leaves but little to the acuteness and strength of wits but places all wits and understandings nearly on a level for as in the drawing of a straight line or a perfect circle much depends on the steadiness and practice of the hand if it be done by aim of hand only but if with the aid of rule or compass little or nothing so is it exactly with my plan but though particular confutations would be of no avail yet touching the sects and general divisions of such systems i must say something something also touching the external signs which show that they are unsound and finally something touching the causes of such great infelicity and of such lasting and general agreement in error that so the access to truth may be made less difficult and the human understanding may the more willingly submit to its purgation and dismiss its idols lxii idols of the theatre or of systems are many and there can be and perhaps will be yet many more for were it not that new for many ages mens minds have been busied with religion and theology and were it not that civil governments especially monarchies have been averse to such novelties even in matters speculative so that men labour therein to the peril and harming of their fortunes — not only unrewarded but exposed also to contempt and envy doubtless there would have arisen many other philosophical sects like to those which in great variety flourished once among the greeks for as on the phenomena of the heavens many hypotheses may be constructed so likewise and more also many various dogmas may be set up and established on the phenomena of philosophy and in the plays of this philosophical theatre you may observe the same thing which is found in the theatre of the poets that stories invented for the stage are more compact and elegant and more as one would wish them to be than true stories out of history in general however there is taken for the material of philosophy either a great deal out of a few things or a very little out of many things so that on both sides philosophy is based on too narrow a foundation of experiment and natural history and decides on the authority of too few cases for the rational school of philosophers snatches from experience a variety of common instances neither duly ascertained nor diligently examined and weighed and leaves all the rest to meditation and agitation of wit there is also another class of philosophers who having bestowed much diligent and careful labour on a few experiments have thence made bold to educe and construct systems wresting all other facts in a strange fashion to conformity therewith and there is yet a third class consisting of those who out of faith and veneration mix their philosophy with theology and traditions among whom the vanity of some has gone so far aside as to seek the origin of sciences among spirits and genii so that this parent stock of errors — this false philosophy — is of three kinds the sophistical the empirical and the superstitious lxiii the most conspicuous example of the first class was aristotle who corrupted natural philosophy by his logic fashioning the world out of categories assigning to the human soul the noblest of substances a genus from words of the second intention doing the business of density and rarity which is to make bodies of greater or less dimensions that is occupy greater or less spaces by the frigid distinction of act and power asserting that single bodies have each a single and proper motion and that if they participate in any other then this results from an external cause and imposing countless other arbitrary restrictions on the nature of things being always more solicitous to provide an answer to the question and affirm something positive in words than about the inner truth of things a failing best shown when his philosophy is compared with other systems of note among the greeks for the homoeomera of anaxagoras the atoms of leucippus and democritus the heaven and earth of parmenides the strife and friendship of empedocles heraclituss doctrine how bodies are resolved into the indifferent nature of fire and remoulded into solids have all of them some taste of the natural philosopher — some savour of the nature of things and experience and bodies whereas in the physics of aristotle you hear hardly anything but the words of logic which in his metaphysics also under a more imposing name and more forsooth as a realist than a nominalist he has handled over again nor let any weight be given to the fact that in his books on animals and his problems and other of his treatises there is frequent dealing with experiments for he had come to his conclusion before he did not consult experience as he should have done in order to the framing of his decisions and axioms but having first determined the question according to his will he then resorts to experience and bending her into conformity with his placets leads her about like a captive in a procession so that even on this count he is more guilty than his modern followers the schoolmen who have abandoned experience altogether lxiv but the empirical school of philosophy gives birth to dogmas more deformed and monstrous than the sophistical or rational school for it has its foundations not in the light of common notions which though it be a faint and superficial light is yet in a manner universal and has reference to many things but in the narrowness and darkness of a few experiments to those therefore who are daily busied with these experiments and have infected their imagination with them such a philosophy seems probable and all but certain to all men else incredible and vain of this there is a notable instance in the alchemists and their dogmas though it is hardly to be found elsewhere in these times except perhaps in the philosophy of gilbert nevertheless with regard to philosophies of this kind there is one caution not to be omitted for i foresee that if ever men are roused by my admonitions to betake themselves seriously to experiment and bid farewell to sophistical doctrines then indeed through the premature hurry of the understanding to leap or fly to universals and principles of things great danger may be apprehended from philosophies of this kind against which evil we ought even now to prepare lxv but the corruption of philosophy by superstition and an admixture of theology is far more widely spread and does the greatest harm whether to entire systems or to their parts for the human understanding is obnoxious to the influence of the imagination no less than to the influence of common notions for the contentious and sophistical kind of philosophy ensnares the understanding but this kind being fanciful and timid and half poetical misleads it more by flattery for there is in man an ambition of the understanding no less than of the will especially in high and lofty spirits of this kind we have among the greeks a striking example in pythagoras though he united with it a coarser and more cumbrous superstition another in plato and his school more dangerous and subtle it shows itself likewise in parts of other philosophies in the introduction of abstract forms and final causes and first causes with the omission in most cases of causes intermediate and the like upon this point the greatest caution should be used for nothing is so mischievous as the apotheosis of error and it is a very plague of the understanding for vanity to become the object of veneration yet in this vanity some of the moderns have with extreme levity indulged so far as to attempt to found a system of natural philosophy on the first chapter of genesis on the book of job and other parts of the sacred writings seeking for the dead among the living which also makes the inhibition and repression of it the more important because from this unwholesome mixture of things human and divine there arises not only a fantastic philosophy but also an heretical religion very meet it is therefore that we be soberminded and give to faith that only which is faiths lxvi so much then for the mischievous authorities of systems which are founded either on common notions or on a few experiments or on superstition it remains to speak of the faulty subjectmatter of contemplations especially in natural philosophy now the human understanding is infected by the sight of what takes place in the mechanical arts in which the alteration of bodies proceeds chiefly by composition or separation and so imagines that something similar goes on in the universal nature of things from this source has flowed the fiction of elements and of their concourse for the formation of natural bodies again when man contemplates nature working freely he meets with different species of things of animals of plants of minerals whence he readily passes into the opinion that there are in nature certain primary forms which nature intends to educe and that the remaining variety proceeds from hindrances and aberrations of nature in the fulfilment of her work or from the collision of different species and the transplanting of one into another to the first of these speculations we owe our primary qualities of the elements to the other our occult properties and specific virtues and both of them belong to those empty compendia of thought wherein the mind rests and whereby it is diverted from more solid pursuits it is to better purpose that the physicians bestow their labour on the secondary qualities of matter and the operations of attraction repulsion attenuation conspissation dilatation astriction dissipation maturation and the like and were it not that by those two compendia which i have mentioned elementary qualities to wit and specific virtues they corrupted their correct observations in these other matters — either reducing them to first qualities and their subtle and incommensurable mixtures or not following them out with greater and more diligent observation to third and fourth qualities but breaking off the scrutiny prematurely — they had made much greater progress nor are powers of this kind i do not say the same but similar to be sought for only in the medicines of the human body but also in the changes of all other bodies but it is a far greater evil that they make the quiescent principles wherefrom and not the moving principles whereby things are produced the object of their contemplation and inquiry for the former tend to discourse the latter to works nor is there any value in those vulgar distinctions of motion which are observed in the received system of natural philosophy as generation corruption augmentation diminution alteration and local motion what they mean no doubt is this — if a body in other respects not changed be moved from its place this is local motion if without change of place or essence it be changed in quality this is alteration if by reason of the change the mass and quantity of the body do not remain the same this is augmentation or diminution if they be changed to such a degree that they change their very essence and substance and turn to something else this is generation and corruption but all this is merely popular and does not at all go deep into nature for these are only measures and limits not kinds of motion what they intimate is how far not by what means or from what source for they do not suggest anything with regard either to the desires of bodies or to the development of their parts it is only when that motion presents the thing grossly and palpably to the sense as different from what it was that they begin to mark the division even when they wish to suggest something with regard to the causes of motion and to establish a division with reference to them they introduce with the greatest negligence a distinction between motion natural and violent a distinction which is itself drawn entirely from a vulgar notion since all violent motion is also in fact natural the external efficient simply setting nature working otherwise than it was before but if leaving all this any one shall observe for instance that there is in bodies a desire of mutual contact so as not to suffer the unity of nature to be quite separated or broken and a vacuum thus made or if any one say that there is in bodies a desire of resuming their natural dimensions or tension so that if compressed within or extended beyond them they immediately strive to recover themselves and fall back to their old volume and extent or if any one say that there is in bodies a desire of congregating towards masses of kindred nature — of dense bodies for instance towards the globe of the earth of thin and rare bodies towards the compass of the sky all these and the like are truly physical kinds of motion — but those others are entirely logical and scholastic as is abundantly manifest from this comparison nor again is it a less evil that in their philosophies and contemplations their labour is spent in investigating and handling the first principles of things and the highest generalities of nature whereas utility and the means of working result entirely from things intermediate hence it is that men cease not from abstracting nature till they come to potential and uninformed matter nor on the other hand from dissecting nature till they reach the atom things which even if true can do but little for the welfare of mankind lxvii a caution must also be given to the understanding against the intemperance which systems of philosophy manifest in giving or withholding assent because intemperance of this kind seems to establish idols and in some sort to perpetuate them leaving no way open to reach and dislodge them this excess is of two kinds the first being manifest in those who are ready in deciding and render sciences dogmatic and magisterial the other in those who deny that we can know anything and so introduce a wandering kind of inquiry that leads to nothing of which kinds the former subdues the latter weakens the understanding for the philosophy of aristotle after having by hostile confutations destroyed all the rest as the ottomans serve their brothers has laid down the law on all points which done he proceeds himself to raise new questions of his own suggestion and dispose of them likewise so that nothing may remain that is not certain and decided a practice which holds and is in use among his successors the school of plato on the other hand introduced acatalepsia at first in jest and irony and in disdain of the older sophists protagoras hippias and the rest who were of nothing else so much ashamed as of seeming to doubt about anything but the new academy made a dogma of it and held it as a tenet and though theirs is a fairer seeming way than arbitrary decisions since they say that they by no means destroy all investigation like pyrrho and his refrainers but allow of some things to be followed as probable though of none to be maintained as true yet still when the human mind has once despaired of finding truth its interest in all things grows fainter and the result is that men turn aside to pleasant disputations and discourses and roam as it were from object to object rather than keep on a course of severe inquisition but as i said at the beginning and am ever urging the human senses and understanding weak as they are are not to be deprived of their authority but to be supplied with helps lxviii so much concerning the several classes of idols and their equipage all of which must be renounced and put away with a fixed and solemn determination and the understanding thoroughly freed and cleansed the entrance into the kingdom of man founded on the sciences being not much other than the entrance into the kingdom of heaven whereinto none may enter except as a little child to cross the seas to any foreign soil peril and toil  wars with their noise affright us  when they cease we are worse in peace  — what then remains but that we still should cry for being born or being born to die ',\n",

but comes not everywhere for i that journey passd with gladder feet than he from hard exile that homeward goes but only ruth of thee without regret for that faiths sake time once enough did show yet

sweet wraths those sweet disdains in you in those sweet peaces written in your eyes diversely many years my fancies drew scarce had i spoken but in lightning wise beaming i saw that gentle smile

virtue be in equal flames our loving hearts were tried at least when once thy love had notice got but one to show the other sought to hide thou didst for mercy call with weary throat in fear and shame

thy desire in all things fully blessd and pleased well only in this i did myself displease  born in too base a town for me to dwell and much i grievd that for thy greater ease at least it stood not

fact was so abhorrd beautie the cause antonius wrongd his wife which could not be decided but by sword great cleopatraes beautie and defects did worke octaviaes wrongs and his neglects what fruit did yeeld that faire forbidden tree but blood dishonour infamie and shame poore blinded queene couldst thou no better see but entertaine disgrace in stead of fame doe these designes with majestie agree to staine thy blood and blot thy royall name that heart that gave consent unto this ill did give consent that thou thy selfe shouldst kill faire rosamund the wonder of her time had bin much fairer had shee not bin faire beautie betraid her thoughts aloft to clime to build strong castles in uncertaine aire where thinfection of a wanton crime did worke her fall first poyson then despaire with double death did kill her perjurd soule when heavenly justice did her sinne controule holy matilda in a haplesse houre of matilda was borne to sorow and to discontent beauty the cause that turnd her sweet to sowre while chastity sought folly to prevent lustfull king john refusd did use his powre by fire and sword to compasse his content but friends disgrace nor fathers banishment nor death it selfe could

by heavenly grace she had such true direction to die with honour not to live in shame and drinke that poyson with a cheerefull heart that could all heavenly grace to her impart this grace great lady doth possesse thy soule and makes thee pleasing in thy makers sight this grace doth all imperfect thoughts controule the introduction directing thee to serve thy god aright to the passion still reckoning him the husband of thy soule of christ which is most pretious in his glorious sight because the worlds delights shee doth denie for him who for her sake vouchsafd to die and dying made her dowager of all nay more coheire of that eternall blisse that angels lost and we by adams fall meere castawaies raisd by a judas kisse christs bloody sweat the vineger and gall the speare sponge nailes his buffeting with fists his bitter passion agony and death did gaine us heaven when he did loose his breath these high deserts invites my lowely muse to write of him and pardon crave of thee for time so spent i need make no excuse before knowing it doth with thy faire minde agree the passion so well as thou no labour wilt refuse that to thy holy love may pleasing be his death and passion i desire to write and thee to reade the blessed soules delight but my deare muse now whither wouldst thou flie above the pitch of thy appointed straine with icarus thou seekest now to trie not waxen wings but thy poore barren braine which farre too weake these siely lines descrie yet cannot this thy forward mind restraine but thy poore infant verse must soare aloft not fearing threatning dangers happening oft thinke when the eye of wisdom shall discover thy weakling muse to flie that scarce could creepe and in the ayre above the clowdes to hover when better ‘twere mued up and fast asleepe theyl thinke with phaeton thou canst neare recover but helplesse with that poore yong lad to weepe the little world of thy weake wit on fire where thou wilt perish in thine owne desire but yet the weaker thou doest seeme to be in sexe or sence the more his glory shines that doth infuze such powerfull grace in thee to shew thy love in these few humble lines the widowes myte with this may well agree her little all more worth than golden mynes beeing more deerer to our loving lord than all the wealth that kingdoms could affoard therefore i humbly for his grace will pray that he will give me power and strength to write that what i have begun so end i may as his great glory may appeare more bright yea in these lines i may no further stray than his most holy spirit shall give me light that blindest weakenesse be not overbold the manner of his passion to unfold in other phrases than may well agree with his pure doctrine and most holy writ that heavens cleare eye and all the world may see i seeke his glory rather than to get the vulgars breath the seed of vanitie nor fames lowd trumpet care i to admit but rather strive in plainest words to showe the matter which i seeke to undergoe a matter farre beyond my barren skill to shew with any life this map of death this storie that whole worlds with bookes would fill in these few lines will put me out of breath to run so swiftly up this mightie hill i may behold it with the eye of faith but to present this pure unspotted lambe i must confesse i farre unworthy am yet if he please tilluminate my spirit and give me wisdom from his holy hill that i may write part of his glorious merit if he vouchsafe to guide my hand and quill to shew his death by which we doe inherit those endlesse joyes that all our hearts doe fill then will i tell of that sad blacke facd night whose mourning mantle covered heavenly light that very night our saviour was betrayed here begins oh night exceeding all the nights of sorow when our most blessed lord although dismayed yet would not he one minutes respite borrow but to mount olives went though sore afraid to welcome night and entertaine the morrow and as he oft unto that place did goe so did he now to meete his long nurst woe he told his deere disciples that they all should be offended by him that selfe night his griefe was great and theirs could not be small to part from him who was their sole delight saint peter thought his faith could never fall no mote could happen in so cleare a sight which made him say though all men were offended yet would he never though his life were ended but his deare lord made answere that before the cocke did crowe he should deny him thrice this could not choose but grieve him very sore that his hot love should proove more cold than ice denying him he did so much adore no imperfection in himselfe he spies but faith againe with him heel surely die rather than his deare master once denie and all the rest did likewise say the same of his disciples at that instant time but yet poore peter he was most too blame that thought above them all by faith to clime his forward speech inflicted sinne and shame when wisdoms eyes did looke and checke his crime who did foresee and told it him before yet would he needs averre it more and more now went our lord unto that holy place sweet gethsemaine hallowed by his presence that blessed garden which did now embrace his holy corps yet could make no defence against those vipers objects of disgrace which sought that pure eternall love to quench here his disciples willed he to stay whilst he went further where he meant to pray none were admitted with their lord to goe but peter and the sonnes of zebedus to them good jesus opened all his woe he gave them leave his sorows to discusse his deepest griefes he did not scorne to showe these three deere friends so much he did intrust beeing sorowfull and overchargd with griefe he told it them yet lookd for no reliefe sweet lord how couldst thou thus to flesh and blood communicate thy griefe tell of thy woes thou knewst they had no powre to doe thee good but were the cause thou must endure these blowes beeing the scorpions bred in adams mud whose poysned sinnes did worke among thy foes to reorecharge thy overburdned soule although the sorowes now they doe condole yet didst thou tell them of thy troubled state of thy soules heavinesse unto the death so full of love so free wert thou from hate to bid them stay whose sinnes did stop thy breath when thou wert entring at so straite a gate yea entring even into the doore of death thou bidst them tarry there and watch with thee who from thy pretious bloodshed were not free bidding them tarry thou didst further goe to meet affliction in such gracefull sort as might moove pitie both in friend and foe thy sorowes such as none could them comport such great indurements who did ever know when to th almighty thou didst make resort and falling on thy face didst humbly pray if ‘twere his will that cup might passe away saying not my will but thy will lord be done when as thou prayedst an angel did appeare from heaven to comfort thee gods onely sonne that thou thy suffrings mightst the better beare beeing in an agony thy glasse neere run thou prayedst more earnestly in so great feare that pretious sweat came trickling to the ground like drops of blood thy sences to confound loe here his will not thy will lord was done and thou content to undergoe all paines sweet lambe of god his deare beloved sonne by this great purchase what to thee remaines of heaven and earth thou hast a kingdom wonne thy glory beeing equall with thy gaines in ratifying gods promise on the earth made many hundred yeares before thy birth but now returning to thy sleeping friends that could not watch one houre for love of thee even those three friends which on thy grace depends yet shut those eies that should their maker see what colour what excuse or what amends from thy displeasure now can set them free yet thy pure pietie bids them watch and pray lest in temptation they be led away although the spirit was willing to obay yet what great weakenesse in the flesh was found they slept in ease whilst thou in paine didst pray loe they in sleepe and thou in sorow drownd yet gods right hand was unto thee a stay when horror griefe and sorow did abound his angel did appeare from heaven to thee to yeeld thee comfort in extremitie but what could comfort then thy troubled minde when heaven and earth were both against thee bent and thou no hope no ease no rest couldst finde but must restore that life which was but lent was ever creature in the world so kinde but he that from eternitie was sent to satisfie for many worlds of sinne whose matchlesse torments did but then begin if one mans sinne doth challendge death and hell with all the torments that belong thereto if for one sinne such plagues on david fell as grieved him and did his seed undoe if salomon for that he did not well falling from grace did loose his kingdome too ten tribes beeing taken from his wilfull sonne and sinne the cause that they were all undone what could thy innocency now expect when all the sinnes that ever were committed were laid to thee whom no man could detect yet farre thou wert of man from beeing pittied the judge so just could yeeld thee no respect nor would one jot of penance be remitted but greater horror to thy soule must rise than heart can thinke or any wit devise now drawes the houre of thy affliction neere and ugly death presents himselfe before thee thou now must leave those friends thou heldst so deere yea those disciples who did most adore thee yet in thy countenance doth no wrath appeare although betrayd to those that did abhorre thee thou didst vouchsafe to visit them againe who had no apprehension of thy paine their eyes were heavie and their hearts asleepe nor knew they well what answere then to make thee yet thou as watchman hadst a care to keepe those few from sinne that shortly would forsake thee but now thou bidst them henceforth rest and sleepe thy houre is come and they at hand to take thee the sonne of god to sinners made a pray oh hatefull houre oh blest oh cursed day loe here thy great humility was found beeing king of heaven and monarch of the earth yet well content to have thy glory drownd by beeing counted of so meane a berth grace love and mercy did so much abound thou entertaindst the crosse even to the death and namdst thy selfe the sonne of man to be to purge our pride by thy humilitie but now thy friends whom thou didst call to goe heavy spectators of thy haplesse case see thy betrayer whom too well they knowe one of the twelve now object of disgrace a trothlesse traytor and a mortall foe with fained kindnesse seekes thee to imbrace and gives a kisse whereby he may deceive thee that in the hands of sinners he might leave thee now muster forth with swords with staves with bils high priests and scribes and elders of the land seeking by force to have their wicked wils which thou didst never purpose to withstand now thou makst haste unto the worst of ils and who they seeke thou gently doest demand this didst thou lord tamaze these fooles the more tinquire of that thou knewst so well before when loe these monsters did not shame to tell his name they sought and found yet could not know jesus of nazareth at whose feet they fell when heavenly wisdome did descend so lowe to speake to them they knew they did not well their great amazement made them backeward goe nay though he said unto them i am he they could not know him whom their eyes did see how blinde were they could not discerne the light how dull if not to understand the truth how weake if meekenesse overcame their might how stony hearted if not movd to ruth how void of pitie and how full of spight gainst him that was the lord of light and truth here insolent boldnesse checkt by love and grace retires and falls before our makers face for when he spake to this accursed crew and mildely made them know that it was he presents himselfe that they might take a view and what they doubted they might cleerely see nay more to reassure that it was true he said i say unto you i am hee if him they sought hes willing to obay onely desires the rest might goe their way thus with a heart prepared to endure the greatest wrongs impietie could devise he was content to stoope unto their lure although his greatnesse might doe otherwise here grace was seised on with hands impure and virtue now must be supprest by vice pure innocencie made a prey to sinne thus did his torments and our joyes beginne here faire obedience shined in his breast and did suppresse all feare of future paine love was his leader unto this unrest whilst righteousnesse doth carry up his traine mercy made way to make us highly blest when patience beat downe sorrow feare and paine justice sate looking with an angry brow on blessed misery appeering now more glorious than all the conquerors than ever livd within this earthly round more powrefull than all kings or governours that ever yet within this world were found more valiant than the greatest souldiers that ever fought to have their glory crownd for which of them that ever yet tooke breath sought tindure the doome of heaven and earth but our sweet saviour whom these jewes did name yet could their learned ignorance apprehend no light of grace to free themselves from blame zeale lawes religion now they doe pretend against the truth untruths they seeke to frame now al their powres their wits their strengths they bend against one siely weake unarmed man who no resistance makes though much he can to free himselfe from these unlearned men who calld him saviour in his blessed name yet farre from knowing him their saviour then that came to save both them and theirs from blame though they retire and fall they come agen to make a surer purchase of their shame with lights and torches now they find the way to take the shepheard whilst the sheep doe stray why should unlawfull actions use the light inniquitie in darkenesse seekes to dwell sinne rides his circuit in the dead of night teaching all soules the ready waies to hell sathan coms armd with all the powres of spight heartens his champions makes them rude and fell like ravning wolves to shed his guiltlesse blood who thought no harme but did to doe them good here falshood beares the shew of formall right base treacherie hath gote a guard of men tyranny attends with all his strength and might to leade this siely lamb to lyons denne yet he unmoovd in this most wretched plight goes on to meete them knowes the houre and when the powre of darkenesse must expresse gods ire therefore to save these few was his desire these few that wait on poverty and shame and offer to be sharers in his ils these few that will be spreaders of his fame he will not leave to tyrants wicked wils but still desires to free them from all blame yet feare goes forward anger patience kils a saint is mooved to revenge a wrong and mildnesse doth what doth to wrath belong for peter grievd at what might then befall yet knew not what to doe nor what to thinke thought something must be done now if at all to free his master that he might not drinke this poysned draught farre bitterer than gall for now he sees him at the very brinke of griesly death who gins to shew his face clad in all colours of a deepe disgrace and now those hands that never usd to fight or drawe a weapon in his owne defence too forward is to doe his master right since of his wrongs hee feeles so true a sence but ah poore peter now thou wantest might and hees resolvd with them he will goe hence to draw thy sword in such a helpelesse cause offends thy lord and is against the lawes so much he hates revenge so farre from hate that he vouchsafes to heale whom thou dost wound his paths are peace with none he holdes debate his patience stands upon so sure a ground to counsell thee although it comes too late nay to his foes his mercies so abound that he in pitty doth thy will restraine and heales the hurt and takes away the paine for willingly he will endure this wrong although his prayrs might have obtaind such grace as to dissolve their plots though ner so strong and bring these wicked actors in worse case than ægypts king on whom gods plagues did throng but that foregoing scriptures must take place if god by prayers had an army sent of powrefull angels who could them prevent yet mightie jesus meekely askd why they with swords and staves doe come as to a thiefe hee teaching in the temple day by day none did offend or give him cause of griefe now all are forward glad is he that may give most offence and yeeld him least reliefe his hatefull foes are ready now to take him and all his deere disciples do forsake him those deare disciples that he most did love and were attendant at his becke and call when triall of affliction came to prove they first left him who now must leave them all for they were earth and he came from above which made them apt to flie and fit to fall though they protest they never will forsake him they do like men when dangers overtake them and he alone is bound to loose us all whom with unhallowed hands they led along to wicked caiphas in the judgement hall who studies onely how to doe him wrong high priests and elders people great and small with all reprochfull words about him throng false witnesses are now calld in apace whose trothlesse tongues must make pale death imbrace the beauty of the world heavens chiefest glory the mirrour of martyrs crowne of holy saints love of thalmighty blessed angels story water of life which none that drinks it faints guide of the just where all our light we borrow mercy of mercies hearer of complaints triumpher over death ransomer of sinne falsly accused now his paines begin their tongues doe serve him as a passing bell for what they say is certainly beleeved so sound a tale unto the judge they tell that he of life must shortly be bereaved their share of heaven they doe not care to sell so his afflicted heart be throughly grieved they tell his words though farre from his intent and what his speeches were not what he meant that he gods holy temple could destroy and in three daies could build it up againe this seemd to them a vaine and idle toy it would not sinke into their sinful braine christs blessed body al true christians joy should die and in three dayes revive againe this did the lord of heaven and earth endure unjustly to be chargd by tongues impure and now they all doe give attentive eare to heare the answere which he will not make the people wonder how he can forbeare and these great wrongs so patiently can take but yet he answers not nor doth he care much more he will endure for our sake nor can their wisdoms any way discover who he should be that proovd so true a lover to entertaine the sharpest pangs of death and fight a combate in the depth of hell for wretched worldlings made of dust and earth whose hardned hearts with pride and mallice swell in midst of bloody sweat and dying breath he had compassion on these tyrants fell and purchast them a place in heavn for ever when they his soule and body sought to sever sinnes ugly mists so blinded had their eyes that at noone dayes they could discerne no light these were those fooles that thought themselves so wise the jewish wolves that did our saviour bite for now they use all meanes they can devise to beate downe truth and goe against all right yea now they take gods holy name in vaine to know the truth which truth they doe prophane the chiefest helhounds of this hatefull crew rose up to aske what answere he could make against those false accusers in his view that by his speech they might advantage take he held his peace yet knew they said not true no answere would his holy wisdome make till he was charged in his glorious name whose pleasure ‘twas he should endure this shame then with so mild a majestie he spake as they might easly know from whence he came his harmelesse tongue doth no exceptions take nor priests nor people meanes he now to blame but answers folly for true wisdomes sake beeing charged deeply by his powrefull name to tell if christ the sonne of god he be who for our sinnes must die to set us free to thee o caiphas doth he answere give that thou hast said what thou desirst to know and yet thy malice will not let him live so much thou art unto thy selfe a foe he speaketh truth but thou wilt not beleeve nor canst thou apprehend it to be so though he expresse his glory unto thee thy owly eies are blind and cannot see thou rendst thy° cloathes in stead of thy false heart and on the guiltlesse laist thy guilty crime for thou blasphemst and he must feele the smart to sentence death thou thinkst it now high time no witnesse now thou needst for this fowle part thou to the height of wickednesse canst clime and give occasion to the ruder sort to make afflictions sorrows follies sport now when the dawne of day gins to appeare and all your wicked counsels have an end to end his life that holds you all so deere for to that purpose did your studies bend proud pontius pilate must the matter heare to your untroths his eares he now must lend sweet jesus bound to him you led away of his most pretious blood to make your pray which when that wicked caytife did perceive by whose lewd meanes he came to this distresse he brought the price of blood he did receive thinking thereby to make his fault seeme lesse and with these priests and elders did it leave confest his fault wherein he did transgresse but when he saw repentance unrespected he hangd himselfe of god and man rejected by this example what can be expected from wicked man which on the earth doth live but faithlesse dealing feare of god neglected who for their private gaine cares not to sell the innocent blood of gods most deere elected as did that caytife wretch now damnd in hell if in christs schoole he tooke so great a fall what will they doe that come not there at all now pontius pilate is to judge the cause of faultlesse jesus who before him stands who neither hath offended prince nor lawes although he now be brought in woefull bands o noble governour make thou yet a pause doe not in innocent blood imbrue thy hands but heare the words of thy most worthy wife who sends to thee to beg her saviours life let barbrous crueltie farre depart from thee and in true justice take afflictions part open thine eies that thou the truth maist see doe not the thing that goes against thy heart condemne not him that must thy saviour be but view his holy life his good desert let not us women glory in mens fall who had power given to overrule us all till now your indiscretion sets us free eves apologie and makes our former fault much lesse appeare our mother eve who tasted of the tree giving to adam what shee held most deare was simply good and had no powre to see the aftercomming harme did not appeare the subtile serpent that our sex betraide before our fall so sure a plot had laide that undiscerning ignorance perceavd no guile or craft that was by him intended for had she knowne of what we were bereavd to his request she had not condiscended but she poore soule by cunning was deceavd no hurt therein her harmelesse heart intended for she alleadgd gods word which he denies that they should die but even as gods be wise but surely adam can not be excusde her fault though great yet hee was most too blame what weaknesse offerd strength might have refusde being lord of all the greater was his shame although the serpents craft had her abusde gods holy word ought all his actions frame for he was lord and king of all the earth before poore eve had either life or breath who being framd by gods eternall hand the perfectst man that ever breathd on earth and from gods mouth receivd that strait command the breach whereof he knew was present death yea having powre to rule both sea and land yet with one apple wonne to loose that breath which god had breathed in his beauteous face bringing us all in danger and disgrace and then to lay the fault on patience backe that we poore women must endure it all we know right well he did discretion lacke beeing not perswaded thereunto at all if eve did erre it was for knowledge sake the fruit beeing faire perswaded him to fall no subtill serpents falshood did betray him if he would eate it who had powre to stay him not eve whose fault was onely too much love which made her give this present to her deare that what shee tasted he likewise might prove whereby his knowledge might become more cleare he never sought her weakenesse to reprove with those sharpe words which he of god did heare yet men will boast of knowledge which he tooke from eves faire hand as from a learned booke if any evill did in her remaine beeing made of him he was the ground of all if one of many worlds could lay a staine upon our sexe and worke so great a fall to wretched man by satans subtill traine what will so fowle a fault amongst you all her weakenesse did the serpents words obay but you in malice gods deare sonne betray whom if unjustly you condemne to die her sinne was small to what you doe commit all mortall sinnes that doe for vengeance crie are not to be compared unto it if many worlds would altogether trie by all their sinnes the wrath of god to get this sinne of yours surmounts them all as farre as doth the sunne another little starre then let us have our libertie againe and challendge to your selves no sovraigntie you came not in the world without our paine make that a barre against your crueltie your fault beeing greater why should you disdaine our beeing your equals free from tyranny if one weake woman simply did offend this sinne of yours hath no excuse nor end to which poore soules we never gave consent witnesse thy wife o pilate speakes for all who did but dreame and yet a message sent that thou shouldst have nothing to doe at all with that just man which if thy heart relent why wilt thou be a reprobate with saul to seeke the death of him that is so good for thy soules health to shed his dearest blood yea so thou maist these sinful people please thou art content against all truth and right to seale this act that may procure thine ease with blood and wrong with tyrannie and might the multitude thou seekest to appease by base dejection of this heavenly light demanding which of these that thou shouldst loose whether the thiefe or christ king of the jewes base barrabas the thiefe they all desire and thou more base than he performst their will yet when thy thoughts backe to themselves retire thou art unwilling to commit this ill oh that thou couldst unto such grace aspire that thy polluted lips might never kill that honour which right judgement ever graceth to purchase shame which all true worth defaceth art thou a judge and asketh what to do with one in whom no fault there can be found the death of christ wilt thou consent unto finding no cause no reason nor no ground shall he be scourgd and crucified too and must his miseries by thy meanes abound yet not ashamd to aske what he hath done when thine owne conscience seeks this sinne to shunne three times thou askst what evill hath he done and saist thou findst in him no cause of death yet wilt thou chasten gods beloved sonne although to thee no word of ill he saith for wrath must end what malice hath begunne and thou must yield to stop his guiltlesse breath this rude tumultuous rowt doth presse so sore that thou condemnest him thou shouldst adore yet pilate this can yeeld thee no content to exercise thine owne authoritie but unto herod he must needes be sent to reconcile thy selfe by tyrannie was this the greatest good in justice meant when thou perceivst no fault in him to be if thou must make thy peace by virtues fall much better ‘twere not to be friends at all yet neither thy sterne browe nor his great place can draw an answer from the holy one his false accusers nor his great disgrace nor herods scoffes to him they are all one he neither cares nor feares his owne ill case though being despisd and mockt of every one king herods gladnesse gives him little ease neither his anger seekes he to appease yet this is strange that base impietie should yeeld those robes of honour which were due pure white to shew his great integritie his innocency that all the world might view perfections height in lowest penury such glorious poverty as they never knew purple and scarlet well might him beseeme whose pretious blood must all the world redeeme and that imperiall crowne of thornes he wore was much more pretious than the diadem of any king that ever livd before or since his time their honours but a dreame to his eternall glory beeing so poore to make a purchasse of that heavenly realme where god with all his angels lives in peace no griefes nor sorrowes but all joyes increase those royall robes which they in scorne did give to make him odious to the common sort yeeld light of grace to those whose soules shall live within the harbour of this heavenly port much doe they joy and much more doe they grieve his death their life should make his foes such sport with sharpest thornes to pricke his blessed face our joyfull sorrow and his greater grace three feares at once possessed pilates heart the first christs innocencie which so plaine appeares the next that he which now must feele this smart is gods deare sonne for any thing he heares but that which proovd the deepest wounding dart is peoples threatnings which he so much feares that he to cæsar could not be a friend unlesse he sent sweet jesus to his end now pilate thou art proovd a painted wall a golden sepulcher with rotten bones from right to wrong from equitie to fall if none upbraid thee yet the very stones his blood his teares his sighes his bitter groanes all these will witnesse at the latter day when water cannot wash thy sinne away canst thou be innocent that gainst all right wilt yeeld to what thy conscience doth withstand beeing a man of knowledge powre and might to let the wicked carrie such a hand before thy face to blindfold heavns bright light and thou to yeeld to what they did demand washing thy hands thy conscience cannot cleare but to all worlds this staine must needs appeare for loe the guiltie doth accuse the just and faultie judge condemnes the innocent and wilfull jewes to exercise their lust with whips and taunts against their lord are bent he basely usd blasphemed scornd and curst our heavenly king to death for us they sent reproches slanders spittings in his face spight doing all her worst in his disgrace and now this long expected houre drawes neere when blessed saints with angels doe condole his holy march soft pace and heavy cheere in humble sort to yeeld his glorious soule by his deserts the fowlest sinnes to cleare and in theternall booke of heaven to enroule a satisfaction till the generall doome of all sinnes past and all that are to come they that had seene this pitifull procession from pilates palace to mount calvarie might thinke he answerd for some great transgression beeing in such odious sort condemnd to die he plainely shewed that his own profession was virtue patience grace love piety and how by suffering he could conquer more than all the kings that ever livd before first went the crier with open mouth proclayming the heavy sentence of iniquitie the hangman next by his base office clayming his right in hell where sinners never die carrying the nayles the people still blaspheming their maker using all impiety the thieves attending him on either side the serjeants watching while the women

troubles which thy rest denies the ashes are the vanities that play over thy head and steale before thine eyes which thou shakst off when mourning time is past that royall roabes thou mayst put on at last joachims wife that faire and constant dame who rather chose a cruel death to die than yeeld to those two elders voide of shame when both at once her chastitie did trie whose innocencie bare away the blame untill thalmighty lord had heard her crie and raisd the spirit of a child to speake making the powrefull judged of the weake although her virtue doe deserve to be writ by that hand that never purchasd blame in holy writ where all the world may see her perfit life and ever honoured name yet was she not to be compard to thee whose many virtues doe increase thy fame for shee opposd against old doting lust who with lifes danger she did feare to trust but your chaste breast guarded with strength of mind hates the imbracements of unchaste desires you loving god live in your selfe confind from unpure love your purest thoughts retires your perfit sight could never be so blind to entertaine the old or yong desires of idle lovers which the world presents whose base abuses worthy minds prevents even as the constant lawrell alwayes greene no parching heate of summer can deface nor pinching winter ever yet was seene whose nipping frosts could wither or disgrace so you deere ladie still remaine as queene subduing all affections that are base unalterable by the change of times not following but lamenting others crimes no feare of death or dread of open shame hinders your perfect heart to give consent nor loathsome age whom time could never tame from ill designes whereto their youth was bent but love of god care to preserve your fame and spend that pretious time that god hath sent in all good exercises of the minde whereto your noble nature is inclind that ethyopian queene did gaine great fame who from the southerne world did come to see great salomon the glory of whose name had spread it selfe ore all the earth to be so great that all the princes thither came to be spectators of his royaltie and this faire queene of sheba came from farre to reverence this new appearing starre from thutmost part of all the earth shee came to heare the wisdom of this worthy king to trie if wonder did agree with fame and many faire rich presents did she bring yea many strange hard questions did shee frame all which were answerd by this famous king nothing was hid that in her heart did rest and all to proove this king so highly blest here majestie with majestie did meete wisdome to wisdome yeelded true content one beauty did another beauty greet bounty to bountie never could repent here all distaste is troden under feet no losse of time where time was so well spent in virtuous exercises of the minde in which this queene did much contentment finde spirits affect where they doe sympathize wisdom desires wisdome to embrace virtue covets her like and doth devize how she her friends may entertaine with grace beauty sometime is pleasd to feed her eyes with viewing beautie in anothers face both good and bad in this point doe agree that each desireth with his like to be and this desire did worke a strange effect to drawe a queene forth of her native land not yeelding to the nicenesse and respect of womankind shee past both sea and land all feare of dangers shee did quite neglect onely to see to heare and understand that beauty wisedome majestie and glorie that in her heart imprest his perfect storie yet this faire map of majestie and might was but a figure of thy deerest love borne texpresse that true and heavenly light that doth all other joyes imperfect prove if this faire earthly starre did shine so bright what doth that glorious sonne that is above who weares thimperiall crowne of heaven and earth and made all christians blessed in his berth if that small sparke could yeeld so great a fire as to inflame the hearts of many kings to come to see to heare and to admire his wisdome tending but to worldly things then much more reason have we to desire that heavnly wisedome which salvation brings the sonne of righteousnesse that gives true joyes when all they fought for were but earthly toyes no travels ought thaffected soule to shunne that this faire heavenly light desires to see this king of kings to whom we all should runne to view his glory and his majestie he without whom we all had beene undone he that from sinne and death hath set us free and overcome satan the world and sinne that by his merits we those joyes might winne prepard by him whose everlasting throne is placd in heaven above the starrie skies where he that sate was like the jasper stone who rightly knowes him shall be truely wise a rainebow round about his glorious throne nay more those winged beasts so full of eies that never cease to glorifie his name who was and will be and is now the same this is that great almightie lord that made both heaven and
