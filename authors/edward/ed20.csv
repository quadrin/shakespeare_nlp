1            In peascod time when hound to horn gives ear while buck is killed,
2            And little boys with pipes of corn sit keeping beasts in field,
3            I went to gather strawberries tho’ when woods and groves were fair,
4            And parched my face with Phoebus, lo, by walking in the air.
5            I lay me down all by a stream and banks all overhead,
6            And there I found the strangest dream, that ever young man had.
7            Methought I saw each Christmas game, both revels all and some,
8            And each thing else that man could name or might by fancy come,
9            The substance of the thing I saw, in silence pass it shall,
10          Because I lack the skill to draw, the order of them all.
11          But Venus shall not ’scape my pen, whose maidens in disdain
12          Sit feeding on the hearts of men, whom Cupid’s bow hath slain.
13          And that blind Boy sat all in blood, bebathed to the ears,
14          And like a conqueror he stood, and scorned lovers’ tears.
15          “I have more hearts,” quoth he, “at call, than Caesar could command.
16          “And like the deer I make them fall, that overcross the land.
17          “I do increase their wand’ring wits, till that I dim their sight.
18          ” ’Tis I that do bereave them of their joy and chief delight.”
19          Thus did I see this bragging Boy advance himself even then,
20          Deriding at the wanton toys, of foolish loving men,
21          Which when I saw for anger then my panting breast did beat,
22          To see how he sat taunting them, upon his royal seat.
23          O then I wished I had been free, and cured were my wound;
24          Methought I could display his arms, and coward deeds expound.
25          But I perforce must stay my muse, full sore against my heart,
26          For that I am a subject wight, and lanced with his dart.
27          But if that I achieve the fort, which I have took in charge,
28          My hand and head with quivering quill, shall blaze his name at large.
