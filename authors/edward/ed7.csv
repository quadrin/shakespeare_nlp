1            My meaning is to work what wonders love hath wrought,
2            Wherewith I muse why men of wit have love so dearly bought;
3            For love is worse than hate, and eke more harm hath done:
4            Record I take of those that rede of Paris, Priam’s son.

5            It seemed the God of sleep had mazed so much his wits
6            When he refused wit for love, which cometh but by fits;
7            But why accuse I him, whom earth hath covered long?
8            There be of his posterity alive, I do him wrong.

9            Whom I might well condemn to be a cruel judge
10          Unto myself, who hath the crime in others that I grudge.
