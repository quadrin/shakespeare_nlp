1            My mind to me a kingdom is;
2            Such perfect joy therein I find
3            That it excels all other bliss
4            That world affords or grows by kind.
5            Though much I want which most men have,
6            Yet still my mind forbids to crave.

7            No princely pomp, no wealthy store,
8            No force to win the victory,
9            No wily wit to salve a sore,
10          No shape to feed each gazing eye,
11          To none of these I yield as thrall.
12          For why? My mind doth serve for all.

13          I see how plenty suffers oft,
14          How hasty climbers soon do fall;
15          I see that those that are aloft
16          Mishap doth threaten most of all;
17          They get with toil, they keep with fear.
18          Such cares my mind could never bear.

19          Content I live, this is my stay;
20          I seek no more than may suffice;
21          I press to bear no haughty sway;
22          Look what I lack my mind supplies.
23          Lo, thus I triumph like a king,
24          Content with that my mind doth bring.

25          Some have too much yet still do crave;
26          I little have and seek no more.
27          They are but poor though much they have
28          And I am rich with little store.
29          They poor, I rich; they beg, I give;
30          They lack, I leave; they pine, I live.

31          I laugh not at another’s loss,
32          I grudge not at another’s gain.
33          No worldly waves my mind can toss;
34          My state at one doth still remain.
35          I fear no foe nor fawning friend,
36          I loathe not life nor dread my end.

37          Some weigh their pleasure by their lust,
38          Their wisdom by their rage of will;
39          Their treasure is their only trust,
40          And cloaked craft their store of skill.
41          But all the pleasure that I find,
42          Is to maintain a quiet mind.

43          My wealth is health and perfect ease,
44          My conscience clear my chief defense;
45          I neither seek by bribes to please
46          Nor by deceit to breed offense.
47          Thus do I live, thus will I die.
48          Would all did so as well as I.
