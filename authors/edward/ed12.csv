1            Winged with desire, I seek to mount on high,
2            Clogged with mishap yet am I kept full low;
3            Who seeks to live and finds the way to die,
4            Sith comfort ebbs, and cares do daily flow,
5            But sad despair would have me to retire,
6            When smiling hope sets forward my desire.

7            I still do toil and never am at rest,
8            Enjoying least when I do covet most;
9            With weary thoughts are my green years oppressed,
10          To danger drawn from my desired coast;
11          Now crazed with Care, then haled up with Hope,
12          With world at will yet wanting wished scope.

13          I like in heart, yet dare not say I love,
14          And looks alone do lend me chief relief.
15          I dwelt sometimes at rest yet must remove,
16          With feigned joy I hide my secret grief.
17          I would possess yet needs must flee the place
18          Where I do seek to win my chiefest grace.

19          Lo, thus I live twixt fear and comfort tossed,
20          With least abode where best I feel content;
21          I seld resort where I should settle most,
22          My sliding times too soon with her are spent;
23          I hover high and soar where Hope doth tower,
24          Yet froward Fate defers my happy hour.

25          I live abroad but still in secret grief,
26          Then least alone when most I seem to lurk;
27          I speak of peace, and live in endless strife,
28          And when I play then are my thoughts at work;
29          In person far that am in mind full near,
30          Making light show where I esteem most dear.

31          A malcontent yet seem I pleased still,
32          Bragging of heaven yet feeling pains of hell.
33          But Time shall frame a time unto my will,
34          Whenas in sport this earnest will I tell;
35          Till then, sweet friend, abide these storms with me,
36          Which shall in joys of either fortunes be.
