1            I am not as I seem to be,
2            Nor when I smile I am not glad,
3            A thrall although you count me free
4            I, most in mirth, most pensive-sad;
5            I smile to shade my bitter spite,
6            As Hannibal, that saw in sight
7            His country soil, with Carthage town,
8            By Roman force defaced down.

9            And Caesar, that presented was
10          With noble Pompey’s princely head,
11          As ’twere some judge to rule the case,
12          A flood of tears he seemed to shed;
13          Although indeed it sprung of joy,
14          Yet others thought it was annoy;
15          Thus contraries be used, I find,
16          Of wise to cloak the covert mind.

17          I Hannibal, that smiles for grief,
18          And let you Caesar’s tears suffice,
19          The one that laughs at his mischief,
20          The other all for joy that cries;
21          I smile to see me scorned so,
22          You weep for joy to see me woe,
23          And I a heart by love slain dead
24          Presents, in place of Pompey’s head.

25          O cruel hap and hard estate
26          That forceth me to love my foe,
27          Accursed by so foul a fate
28          My choice for to prefix it so,
29          So long to fight with secret sore,
30          And find no secret salve therefor;
31          Some purge their pain by plaint, I find,
32          But I in vain do breathe my wind.
