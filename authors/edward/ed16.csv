1            Were I a king I could command content;
2            Were I obscure unknown should be my cares,
3            And were I dead no thought should me torment,
4            Nor words, nor wrongs, nor loves, nor hopes, nor fears;
5            A doubtful choice of these things one to crave,
6            A kingdom or a cottage or a grave.
