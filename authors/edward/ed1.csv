The labouring man that tills the fertile soil
2            And reaps the harvest fruit hath not indeed
3            The gain, but pain, and if for all his toil
4            He gets the straw, the Lord will have the seed.

5            The Manchet fine falls not unto his share,
6            On coarsest cheat his hungry stomach feeds.
7            The Landlord doth possess the finest fare;
8            He pulls the flowers, the other plucks but weeds.

9            The mason poor, that builds the Lordly halls,
10          Dwells not in them, they are for high degree;
11          His Cottage is compact in paper walls,
12          And not with brick or stone as others be.

13          The idle Drone that labours not at all
14          Sucks up the sweet of honey from the Bee.
15          Who worketh most, to their share least doth fall;
16          With due desert reward will never be.

17          The swiftest Hare unto the Mastiff slow
18          Oft times doth fall to him as for a prey;
19          The Greyhound thereby doth miss his game we know
20          For which he made such speedy haste away.

21          So he that takes the pain to pen the book
22          Reaps not the gifts of goodly golden Muse,
23          But those gain that who on the work shall look,
24          And from the sour the sweet by skill doth choose.

25          For he that beats the bush the bird not gets,
26          But who sits still, and holdeth fast the nets.
