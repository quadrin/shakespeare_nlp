Gentle Reader, if thou desire to be resolued, why I
giue this Title, Salue Deus Rex Judaeorum, know
for certaine, that it was deliuered vnto me in sleepe
many yeares before I had any intent to write in this
maner, and was quite out of my memory vntill I had written
the Passion of Christ, when immediately it came into my re-
membrance, what I had dreamed long before; and thinking
it a significant token, that I was appointed to performe that
Worke, I gaue the very same words I receiued in sleepe as the
fittest Title I could deuise for this Booke.
