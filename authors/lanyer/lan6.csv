Most gratious Ladie, faire ELIZABETH,
Whose Name and Virtues puts us still in mind,
Of her, of whom we are depriv'd by death;
The Phoenix of her age, whose worth did bind
All worthy minds so long as they have breath,
In linkes of Admiration, love and zeale,
To that deare Mother of our Common-weale.

Even you faire Princesse next our famous Queene,
I doe invite unto this wholesome feast,
Whose goodly wisedome, though your yeares be greene,
By such good workes may daily be increast,
Though your faire eyes farre better Bookes have seene;
Yet being the first fruits of a womans wit,
Vouchsafe you[r] favour in accepting it.
