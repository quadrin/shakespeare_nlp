FAIRE dog, which so my heart dost teare asunder,
That my liue's-blood my bowels ouerfloweth :
Alas, what wicked rage conceal'st thou vnder
These sweet enticing ioyes thy forehead showeth :
Me, whom the light-wing'd god of long hath chased,
Thou hast attain'd : thou gau'st that fatall wound
Which my soule's peacefull innocence hath rased,
And Reason to her seruant Humour bound.

Kill therefore in the end, and end my anguish,
Give me my death; me thinks euen Time vpbraideth
A fulness of the woes, wherein I languish:
Or if thou wilt I liue, then Pittie pleadeth
      Help out of thee, since Nature hath reuealed,
      That with thy tongue thy bytings may be healed.
