More than most fair, full of that heavenly fire,
Kindled above to show the Maker's glory* ;
Beauty's first-born, in whom all powers conspire
To write the Graces' life, and Muses' story :
    If in my heart all saints else be defaced,
    Honour the shrine, where you alone are placed.

Thou window of the sky, and pride of spirits,
True character of Honour in perfection ;
Thou heavenly creature, judge of earthly merits,
And glorious prison of man's pure affection ;
    If in my heart all nymphs else be defaced,
    Honour the shrine, where you alone are placed.
